And you might be wondering how that sort of thing could happen.\r\n\r\nWeb advertising at large newspaper and media websites (at least the ones I've worked at), works something like this:\r\n\r\nThe newspaper website has a lot more ad inventory than its salespeople can sell. Especially in non-local areas such as Nation/World.\r\n\r\nEach ad position on a page calls the main ad server (in Gannett's case, <a href=\"http://gannett.gcion.com\">gannett.gcion.com</a>) through javascript and says, \"Give me an ad.\" Said ad server checks to see if it has any local- or network-scheduled ad. If it does, that ad, which generally has been seen, approved and checked, is sent down to the user.\r\n\r\nFailing that, it will pass the request for an ad on to another server to fill the spot, sight-unseen.\r\n\r\nAnd these third-party, or \"remnant\" (because they get the leftover) ad providers are unscrupulous customers.\r\n\r\nYou've seen these ads. The dancing mortgage people. The teeth-whiteners.\r\n\r\nThe sketchiest of the sketchy.\r\n\r\nAnd the dirtiest of the dirtiest.\r\n\r\nIn my time at The Indianapolis Star, we saw remnant ads include large files intended to do nothing but <a href=\"http://antivirus.about.com/od/securitytips/a/historysniffing.htm\">sniff your browser history</a>.\r\n\r\nEighty-percent of the time, when users or staff would complain about page speed, we knew without looking there was a third-party ad to blame.\r\n\r\nThey're either bloated with logic to sniff out users' information or coded so poorly that it just takes forever to load.\r\n\r\nAs an example, a lot of remnant ad designers think of their little ad box as a separate little webpage: including their own javascript libraries, regardless of whether or not the site they appear on already has those libraries installed. Worse yet, they sometimes will include them in a such a way that they conflict with the libraries on the parent page and wreck the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThese ads are bad, and they don't make publishers much money, bringing in a significantly lower CPM than local- or network-sold advertising.\r\n\r\nSo why do newspaper websites (and large media websites in general) continue to use them and continue to increase ad inventory with no hope of ever selling ads in those spaces?\r\n\r\nBecause it's free money.\r\n\r\nIt's not much money, granted, but you have zero overhead. Slap an ad position on a page and you get back fractions of a penny every time that ad gets viewed.\r\n\r\nNo local salesperson is needed or involved. The third-party ad network takes care of sales, scheduling and delivery.\r\n\r\nWhen you lose that local overhead, though, you also loose something more important: control over the ads your users see.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a bad ad, how do you turn it off? You have to call somebody, wait on hold, explain the ad, get them to understand the problem and then turn it off. You can't turn the ad off, the third-party advertiser has to do that work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the whole time you're on hold and haggling, that damn ad will still be on your site, ruining your good name and permanently driving away readers.\r\n\r\nOr you do what The StarTrib did: you turn off <em>all your ads</em> and bleed money by the second and pageview until you get everything resolved with the ad providers.\r\n\r\nI will argue (and have argued), that what newspaper and other media websites need, financially, is fewer ad positions, not more. It reduces the reliance on untrustworthy and damaging third-party ads and can help drive up the CPM-per-ad on those locally sold.\r\n\r\nBetter yet, put pressure on your ad departments: You only get ad positions you have sold. If you don't have an ad for this spot, it goes away.\r\n\r\nFill the spots, for whatever price you can get, because we aren't going to let somebody else do it for you anymore.","html":"<p>First a little context: <a href=\"http://startribune.com\">The Minneapolis Star-Tribune website</a> earlier this week had <a href=\"http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/02/star_tribune_in.php\">an advertisement</a> that included a bit of a social engineering hack related to viruses (according to a Twin Cities blog).</p>\n\n<p>Said post also includes an offhand mention of other newspaper websites owned by Gannett having a similar ad.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I saw the headline come across my feedreader, I thought, \"Goddamn remnant ads.\"</p>\n\n<p>I can nearly guarantee no one at The Star Tribune approved, scheduled or even saw the ad before users started complaining.

The teeth-whiteners.</p>\n\n<p>The sketchiest of the sketchy.</p>\n\n<p>And the dirtiest of the dirtiest.</p>\n\n<p>In my time at The Indianapolis Star, we saw remnant ads include large files intended to do nothing but <a href=\"http://antivirus.about.com/od/securitytips/a/historysniffing.htm\">sniff your browser history</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Eighty-percent of the time, when users or staff would complain about page speed, we knew without looking there was a third-party ad to blame.</p>\n\n<p>They're either bloated with logic to sniff out users' information or coded so poorly that it just takes forever to load.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, a lot of remnant ad designers think of their little ad box as a separate little webpage: including their own javascript libraries, regardless of whether or not the site they appear on already has those libraries installed. Worse yet, they sometimes will include them in a such a way that they conflict with the libraries on the parent page and wreck the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>These ads are bad, and they don't make publishers much money, bringing in a significantly lower CPM than local- or network-sold advertising.</p>\n\n<p>So why do newspaper websites (and large media websites in general) continue to use them and continue to increase ad inventory with no hope of ever selling ads in those spaces?</p>\n\n<p>Because it's free money.</p>\n\n<p>It's not much money, granted, but you have zero overhead. Slap an ad position on a page and you get back fractions of a penny every time that ad gets viewed.</p>\n\n<p>No local salesperson is needed or involved. The third-party ad network takes care of sales, scheduling and delivery.</p>\n\n<p>When you lose that local overhead, though, you also loose something more important: control over the ads your users see.</p>\n\n<p>When you have a bad ad, how do you turn it off? You have to call somebody, wait on hold, explain the ad, get them to understand the problem and then turn it off. You can't turn the ad off, the third-party advertiser has to do that work.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the whole time you're on hold and haggling, that damn ad will still be on your site, ruining your good name and permanently driving away readers.</p>\n\n<p>Or you do what The StarTrib did: you turn off <em>all your ads</em> and bleed money by the second and pageview until you get everything resolved with the ad providers.</p>\n\n<p>I will argue (and have argued), that what newspaper and other media websites need, financially, is fewer ad positions, not more. It reduces the reliance on untrustworthy and damaging third-party ads and can help drive up the CPM-per-ad on those locally sold.</p>\n\n<p>Better yet, put pressure on your ad departments: You only get ad positions you have sold. If you don't have an ad for this spot, it goes away.</p>\n\n<p>Fill the spots, for whatever price you can get, because we aren't going to let somebody else do it for you anymore.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1381864824473,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1381864824473,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1267049588000,"published_by":1},{"id":6,"uuid":"b7aa3ecd-1fb1-496a-a452-cf8f952c8366","title":"Introducing Montabe","slug":"introducing-montabe","markdown":"[Not to bury the lede: Montabe is a new photo and gallery management web application I'm building.

Getting those photos on the site usually involves getting them to email them to us, then uploading them to the site. The process sucks.\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly common pain point anytime you deal with photo projects that involve multiple photographers. We went to a friend's wedding in the past where they asked attendees to take photos and send them to them. I built a quick website to allow them to upload them, but few people did because it required a manual upload.\r\n\r\nI also thought about, given my journalism background, breaking news events that require a call for photos.

It's an experiment I've been thinking about for a long time now.\r\n\r\nThose thoughts have very little to do with Twitter's recent foray <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api\">into developer crackdown</a>, but it helped make this final flip over to this arrangement (temporary though it may be).\r\n\r\nLargely, I started thinking back over all the content I've written over on Twitter: four jobs, two kids, an autism diagnosis for one of those kids, a house purchase and 10,000+ bits of my life at 140 characters or so at a time. It's a pretty big chunk of my life and I have no way of accessing much of it.\r\n\r\nOh, it's in there somewhere, buried in a Twitter database of some sort in a datacenter of some sort and accessible if you know the URL for each individual tweet. But I can't readily access anything older than <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline\">my most recent 3,200 tweets</a>. I can't find that tweet where I welcomed my son into the world. Or on the day he was diagnosed with autism. Or the day my daughter was born.\r\n\r\nThey're all as good as gone.\r\n\r\nI'm hopeful that some day in the future, Twitter will let us go back further, or let us download all of our tweets, but I'm not willing to wait that long.\r\n\r\nAnd <a href=\"https://join.app.net/\">app.net</a> is really no better. At some point, I'll realize I'm handing over all of these moments in my life to live on someone else's servers, in someone else's databases and someone else's datacenters, and end up right back where I am today.\r\n\r\nSo, for now I'll go with this bailing wire and duct tape approach:\r\n\r\nAnything that goes to Twitter will start its life here as a <a href=\"http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/tumblog/statuses/\">\"Status\" tumblelog item</a>.\r\n\r\nOnce I publish, it'll post something to Twitter.

It's an experiment I've been thinking about for a long time now.</p>\n\n<p>Those thoughts have very little to do with Twitter's recent foray <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api\">into developer crackdown</a>, but it helped make this final flip over to this arrangement (temporary though it may be).</p>\n\n<p>Largely, I started thinking back over all the content I've written over on Twitter: four jobs, two kids, an autism diagnosis for one of those kids, a house purchase and 10,000+ bits of my life at 140 characters or so at a time. It's a pretty big chunk of my life and I have no way of accessing much of it.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, it's in there somewhere, buried in a Twitter database of some sort in a datacenter of some sort and accessible if you know the URL for each individual tweet. But I can't readily access anything older than <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/user_timeline\">my most recent 3,200 tweets</a>. I can't find that tweet where I welcomed my son into the world. Or on the day he was diagnosed with autism. Or the day my daughter was born.</p>\n\n<p>They're all as good as gone.</p>\n\n<p>I'm hopeful that some day in the future, Twitter will let us go back further, or let us download all of our tweets, but I'm not willing to wait that long.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://join.app.net/\">app.net</a> is really no better. At some point, I'll realize I'm handing over all of these moments in my life to live on someone else's servers, in someone else's databases and someone else's datacenters, and end up right back where I am today.</p>\n\n<p>So, for now I'll go with this bailing wire and duct tape approach:</p>\n\n<p>Anything that goes to Twitter will start its life here as a <a href=\"http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/tumblog/statuses/\">\"Status\" tumblelog item</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once I publish, it'll post something to Twitter. Right now, I'm routing everything through <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/\">Buffer</a>, but I'll be changing that shortly (once I find/build a WP-to-Twitter solution that handles what I'd like it to do).</p>\n\n<p>I'm still going to use <a href=\"http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a> and the like to follow folks on Twitter. I like too many folks over there to cut it out completely, after all. Longer-term, I might look for other ways to handle that, but that's less of a concern for me than making sure I have access to and control over the originals of what I write, no matter how short and insignificant those writings may seem from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1381864824500,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1381864824500,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1345750821000,"published_by":1},{"id":22,"uuid":"dad0d229-e948-4946-9d52-393c97d09533","title":"(no title)","slug":"replies","markdown":"One thing I'll need to figure out is how to handle replies.

Approximately 80% of insurance plans in Indiana don't fall under this mandate. My plan at my last employer, Angie's List, was exempt from the mandate, for instance. We were lucky again that AL adjusted their plan rules to cover Benjamin's therapy.

The Affordable Care Act will be able to be fully enacted and Indiana doesn't have the ignominy of having a laughingstock for a Senator.</p>\n<p>However, one thing I've realized between <a href=\"http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/2012/11/why-i-voted/\">yesterday's post</a> and today is that the macro level really doesn't affect the things I care most about - early childhood education and the retention of the state Autism mandate - all that much (especially now that macro level health care reform is locked in for a while). Presidential and Senate races are big deals, but to affect the change I want to see and protect the things I feel strongly need protection, I need to look smaller and more local.</p>\n<p>After last night, we have a Tea Party favorite and social conservative for a governor. We also have down ballot races in my district (largely the Indy suburbs with a bit of Marion County proper) still too close to call, despite featuring a pair of Republican candidates that should be so far out of the mainstream to have had a shot.</p>\n<p>These are the races that should matter to me much more than turning Indiana blue at a macro level. It's also smaller races where a ground game and proper organization can make a much bigger difference (something the right wing discovered/realized long ago).</p>\n<p>In my younger days, I was much more political. I led the West Virginia University Young Democrats for a while and volunteered on the 1996 Clinton reelection campaign, including a stint helping with an inaugural ball after that successful election.</p>\n<p>In the years since, I've largely drifted away. Life got in the way to a degree and until Obama, I saw very little appeal in Democratic candidates. In general, though, I didn't see a lot of things worth fighting for, or grew complacent thinking that things wouldn't change much no matter the party involved.</p>\n<p>At this point, though, I have things I want to fight for. I want to fight for the right of every child diagnosed with Autism to get the same level of care that our son Benjamin has had. I also want to fight to improve an early childhood eduction system in this state that appalls me (no fully-funded K, no preschool infrastructure at all, <a href=\"http://www.childrensdefense.org/child-research-data-publications/data/state-data-repository/full-day-k/2012-indiana-full-day-k-factsheet.pdf\">more here</a>).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned yesterday, I feel one party gives me the best chance for those two goals. But the Indiana Democratic Party infrastructure (admittedly from the outside), seems poorly run and running scared. When it takes a monumental gaffe to keep someone like Richard Mourdock from winning a Senate seat, there's something wrong.

The Affordable Care Act will be able to be fully enacted and Indiana doesn't have the ignominy of having a laughingstock for a Senator.</p>  \n\n<p>However, one thing I've realized between <a href=\"http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/2012/11/why-i-voted/\">yesterday's post</a> and today is that the macro level really doesn't affect the things I care most about - early childhood education and the retention of the state Autism mandate - all that much (especially now that macro level health care reform is locked in for a while). Presidential and Senate races are big deals, but to affect the change I want to see and protect the things I feel strongly need protection, I need to look smaller and more local.</p>  \n\n<p>After last night, we have a Tea Party favorite and social conservative for a governor. We also have down ballot races in my district (largely the Indy suburbs with a bit of Marion County proper) still too close to call, despite featuring a pair of Republican candidates that should be so far out of the mainstream to have had a shot.</p>  \n\n<p>These are the races that should matter to me much more than turning Indiana blue at a macro level. It's also smaller races where a ground game and proper organization can make a much bigger difference (something the right wing discovered/realized long ago).</p>  \n\n<p>In my younger days, I was much more political. I led the West Virginia University Young Democrats for a while and volunteered on the 1996 Clinton reelection campaign, including a stint helping with an inaugural ball after that successful election.</p>  \n\n<p>In the years since, I've largely drifted away. Life got in the way to a degree and until Obama, I saw very little appeal in Democratic candidates. In general, though, I didn't see a lot of things worth fighting for, or grew complacent thinking that things wouldn't change much no matter the party involved.</p>  \n\n<p>At this point, though, I have things I want to fight for. I want to fight for the right of every child diagnosed with Autism to get the same level of care that our son Benjamin has had. I also want to fight to improve an early childhood eduction system in this state that appalls me (no fully-funded K, no preschool infrastructure at all, <a href=\"http://www.childrensdefense.org/child-research-data-publications/data/state-data-repository/full-day-k/2012-indiana-full-day-k-factsheet.pdf\">more here</a>).</p>  \n\n<p>As I mentioned yesterday, I feel one party gives me the best chance for those two goals. But the Indiana Democratic Party infrastructure (admittedly from the outside), seems poorly run and running scared. When it takes a monumental gaffe to keep someone like Richard Mourdock from winning a Senate seat, there's something wrong.

If I know anything about myself, it's that any amount of friction to producing something means I'm less likely to do it.\n\n## Features\n\n* The Service is available in every OSX application. It works (or is intended to work) anywhere you have a cursor in a text box.\n* Can pull from 0-3 tags with each pull. So, you can pull from none to get just your 10 most recent bookmarks, or combine a few of them.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Dependency:** To decode the response from the [Pinboard API][0161-002], this workflow relies on the <code>json</code> gem, so you'll need to install that if you haven't already.\n\nOf note, you'll need to have the [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed to do this.\n\nOpen a Terminal window, and type:\n\n<code>sudo gem install json</code>\n\nAnd you should be good to go. If you're a Ruby developer using [rvm][0161-003] or [rbenv][0161-004], make sure you install <code>json</code> in the system Ruby, since the Service uses <code>/usr/bin/ruby</code>.\n\nOn with the show:\n\n1. [Download the workflow file.](http://cvprojects.s3.amazonaws.com/PinboardDigest.workflow.zip)\n2. Double-click the zip file you just downloaded to extract the <code>.workflow</code> file.\n3. Place that workflow file in <code>HOME/Library/Services</code> (or just double click it).

I generally prefer a backpack for my carryon for a couple of reasons:\n\n* **Agility:** For one of my typical work flights, I have a very short layover to get from one end of the Minneapolis airport to the other. It's not quite a sprint, but it's close. Having a backpack instead of a rollerbag lets me move a lot quicker.\n* **Keeping it with me:** When traveling alone, where do you put your bag when you head to the bathroom? With a rollerbag, you're putting that sucker on an airport bathroom floor. With the backpack, it stays right there with you, high above the grime (something Dan and Merlin talk about _a lot_).\n* **In-flight flexibility:** Assuming you haven't loaded it to the gills, this particular backpack will also fit under the seat. So if the overheads are full of sideways rollerbags, or you just don't feel like screwing with it, you can just stuff it under the seat and be done with it.\n* **Everyday use:** I'll touch more on this in a bit, but I don't really travel enough to have a bag specialized just for the airport and plane.

I generally prefer a backpack for my carryon for a couple of reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agility:</strong> For one of my typical work flights, I have a very short layover to get from one end of the Minneapolis airport to the other. It's not quite a sprint, but it's close. Having a backpack instead of a rollerbag lets me move a lot quicker.</li>\n<li><strong>Keeping it with me:</strong> When traveling alone, where do you put your bag when you head to the bathroom? With a rollerbag, you're putting that sucker on an airport bathroom floor. With the backpack, it stays right there with you, high above the grime (something Dan and Merlin talk about <em>a lot</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>In-flight flexibility:</strong> Assuming you haven't loaded it to the gills, this particular backpack will also fit under the seat. So if the overheads are full of sideways rollerbags, or you just don't feel like screwing with it, you can just stuff it under the seat and be done with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Everyday use:</strong> I'll touch more on this in a bit, but I don't really travel enough to have a bag specialized just for the airport and plane. I needed a bag that can pull double duty.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.511tactical.com/\">5.11</a>, the maker of this particular backpack, is better known for a) <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/04/i-love-my-tacti/\">tactical internet pants</a> and b) survivalist gear (just read the Amazon reviews on that sucker).</p>\n\n<p>This bag in particular has been great for my purposes, however.</p>\n\n<p>The sleeve in the back, which is intended to hold a <a href=\"http://www.camelbak.com/\">CamelBak</a> water system, is a nicely padded space to hold a laptop (or two ...

I don't generally mind sponsorships on the podcasts I listen to, but I'm not doing this as a direct means of income. The primary reason is I just want to have these conversations and talk about these things; if it brings me (and my guests) a larger audience, so much the better, but it's not the primary goal.\n* I largely want the guest list to not be the usual suspects. As I alluded to earlier, everybody has stories and insights, and I suspect we'll find out that those from a more unknown developer or manager will be just as fascinating (if not more so because the stories are new) as the names you know.\n* For audio production purposes, I'm getting my new [Blue Yeti](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) mic delivered today. I'll largely be following [Jason Snell's advice](http://www.macworld.com/article/1162062/skype_garageband_podcast_tips.html), except using [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) instead of [Ecamm Call Recorder](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/), mostly because I have it already. Myself and my guest will each record our own end of the conversation and then I'll stitch it all back together before publishing.\n* I'm still a bit undecided on hosting for the podcast. This blog is running off [Ghost](http://ghost.org), which doesn't exactly support that sort of thing. Most of my other sites are running off [Paperplane](http://paperplane.io) at this point, but I don't feel like finagling a static site generator to produce a podcast site and feed. I also have no intention of running Wordpress. In short: I'm exploring my options here and if you have suggestions, [let me know](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com).\n* To start at least, I don't plan to have theme music or anything more than a [cold open](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open) and then maybe tacking a bit on at the end. We'll see how that goes.\n* Every episode will have show notes, and hopefully fairly extensive ones.\n\n<hr />\n\nThank you all for following along.

As I alluded to earlier, everybody has stories and insights, and I suspect we'll find out that those from a more unknown developer or manager will be just as fascinating (if not more so because the stories are new) as the names you know.</li>\n<li>For audio production purposes, I'm getting my new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">Blue Yeti</a> mic delivered today. I'll largely be following <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1162062/skype_garageband_podcast_tips.html\">Jason Snell's advice</a>, except using <a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/\">Audio Hijack Pro</a> instead of <a href=\"http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/\">Ecamm Call Recorder</a>, mostly because I have it already. Myself and my guest will each record our own end of the conversation and then I'll stitch it all back together before publishing.</li>\n<li>I'm still a bit undecided on hosting for the podcast. This blog is running off <a href=\"http://ghost.org\">Ghost</a>, which doesn't exactly support that sort of thing. Most of my other sites are running off <a href=\"http://paperplane.io\">Paperplane</a> at this point, but I don't feel like finagling a static site generator to produce a podcast site and feed. I also have no intention of running Wordpress. In short: I'm exploring my options here and if you have suggestions, <a href=\"mailto:<a href='mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com'>chris@chrisvannoy.com</a>\">let me know</a>.</li>\n<li>To start at least, I don't plan to have theme music or anything more than a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open\">cold open</a> and then maybe tacking a bit on at the end. We'll see how that goes.</li>\n<li>Every episode will have show notes, and hopefully fairly extensive ones.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Thank you all for following along. I'm still booking guests, so <a href=\"mailto:<a href='mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com'>chris@chrisvannoy.com</a>\">drop me a line</a> if the sort of conversation outlined above sounds like something you'd be interested in.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1386781767342,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1386781986185,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1386781772309,"published_by":1},{"id":58,"uuid":"18aad0b3-fca8-46ca-b969-32a77eb87924","title":"Being a developer is not about how talented you are","slug":"the-core-of-the-hiring-handbook","markdown":"<p>As I&#8217;ve been writing <a href=\"http://hiring.chrisvannoy.com\">&#8220;The Hiring Handbook&#8221;</a>, I&#8217;ve also been reading a ton of blog posts and things about recruiting and hiring developers.</p>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224929\">make me mad</a>,<a href=\"#fn:1\" id=\"fnref:1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]</a> some <a href=\"http://nickfranc.is/hiring-is-marketing\">are good</a>, but all have helped me distill my thoughts on this to one simple core belief that everything I&#8217;m writing about centers around.</p>\n\n<p>This belief is as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Being a developer is not about how talented you are.

How you treat others.\n\n## Grow\n\n* Don't limit your growth. \n* Traffic + Iteration = Growth: Phase focuses on traffic. When you focus on the top of the funnel, everything below it gets better. AB testing goes faster. Traffic = grow word of mouth, content, ads\n* Growth comes from obsessing about your customers\n* Time is your scarcest resource. The one thing you always have against you. Don't do things worth doing.\n* Continuously make improvements.\n\n## Q&A\n\n* Pricing: If you tier, focus on how your customer buys. What do they currently buy? How do they buy? \"Strategies of pricing and tactics\", really think book kinda expensive. Most thorough read on pricing. People get scared about changing pricing on their customers. Don't be scared. \n* How to start measuring/what to measure: If you're not logging things transactional, start doing so. Every log in of a user, for instance. What is the one system that's the most important system you need to make repeatable, measure that first. \n* How to focus on most ideal customer: google problem hypothesis. Be very specific in hypothesis. \n* Charging early for enterprise: Even more important. \n* Don't go heavy on quantitative metrics early on. More talking to people and finding the pain. What problem do they have? Do I hit a nerve, is there a pattern in the conversation. No sense measuring if you have a product that doesn't matter.","html":"<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> These recaps are a bit more for me than you.

What gets measured, gets managed</li>\n<li>Optimize for learning: Why did you make more money this month?</li>\n<li>You are a reflection of your company. What you say. Who you are. How you treat others.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"grow\">Grow</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't limit your growth. </li>\n<li>Traffic + Iteration = Growth: Phase focuses on traffic. When you focus on the top of the funnel, everything below it gets better. AB testing goes faster. Traffic = grow word of mouth, content, ads</li>\n<li>Growth comes from obsessing about your customers</li>\n<li>Time is your scarcest resource. The one thing you always have against you. Don't do things worth doing.</li>\n<li>Continuously make improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"qa\">Q&amp;A</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pricing: If you tier, focus on how your customer buys. What do they currently buy? How do they buy? \"Strategies of pricing and tactics\", really think book kinda expensive. Most thorough read on pricing. People get scared about changing pricing on their customers. Don't be scared. </li>\n<li>How to start measuring/what to measure: If you're not logging things transactional, start doing so. Every log in of a user, for instance. What is the one system that's the most important system you need to make repeatable, measure that first. </li>\n<li>How to focus on most ideal customer: google problem hypothesis. Be very specific in hypothesis. </li>\n<li>Charging early for enterprise: Even more important. </li>\n<li>Don't go heavy on quantitative metrics early on. More talking to people and finding the pain. What problem do they have? Do I hit a nerve, is there a pattern in the conversation. No sense measuring if you have a product that doesn't matter.</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1397495773331,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1397495897024,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1397495781060,"published_by":1},{"id":64,"uuid":"ca404d2c-3c9c-4c39-95a3-355d37f6a26d","title":"Microconf 2014: Business Hacks & Epic Wins","slug":"microconf-2014-business-hacks-epic-wins","markdown":"<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> These recaps are a bit more for me than you.

Trying over and over to make things work the same way. Feeling like you have to stay within the lines to be successful. \n* Repetitive, inflexible actions: \"Always\", \"Never\", \"Must, \"Should\". \n* This is _never_ going to work, I'm wasting my time.\n* Fear dictates decisions.\n* It has to be this way or that way.\n* If this doesn't go the way I wanted to, there will be severe, catastrophic consequences. This is rarely true.\n* Fear is the primary driver behind rigidity. Desire to control external variables. The fear of what you can't control. A dangerous way to live. We all go there sometimes, but if it's all the time, you might need to ask, \"Am I well?\"\n\n## Finding balance between chaos and rigidity\n\n* Time out = a change in perspective. Step outside of well-worn patterns to do something else. \n* Sleep is a really important way to take time out. Exercise and nutrition. All three take dedicated attention.\n* Play. Taking time out to have fun. To be something more than your app.\n* Take breaks from screens. We can forget how to sit eye-to-eye with someone. We want to let our brain do something different, a change of pace and change on content.\n* Travel. Time out to enjoy novelty. To understand the world is big, and you want to put your app in the proper place.\n* Service. Spend time helping charity. Understanding that even if you're struggling with your app, you have a role in the well-being of another person.\n* Puts your experience in a larger context.\n* It's a privilege to do this kind of work.\n* Sleep is the single most important behavioral activity. Helps keep us healthy, give a time when your brain is incredibly active. Your brain is working on complex problems while you're sleeping.\n* [TED Talk][2782-003]\n* Time out: Breathe. Interrupt the feedback loop between your body and your mind.\n* Even something as simple as four breaths can stop the anxiety cycle.\n* Time in = engaging in a deeper way.\n* Engaging your work in an intentional way.\n* Carve out uninterrupted time to do one thing. Keep it sacrosanct.\n* Conferences: giving you time and space to learn outside of your normal schedule.\n* Masterminds: You want to do it on your own, but you actually can't do that. We all need others. We need feedback. \n* Who are your role models?\n* Who can help you find balance?\n* Who do you trust to be part of your feedback loop?\n* Very specific, tailored feedback.\n* _Question: How do you find these sorts of relationships? Just blindly email? Something more?_\n* Personal metrics: Thinking about thinking. \n* What kind of data should you track?\n* What was life giving today? What sucked life today? What was my high point? Low point? Where did I feel flow? Where didn't I?\n* Important data to know what you actually enjoy doing.\n* Record a daily checkin or journal.\n* Write one thing that went well or made you happy today.\n* When we dare to be self-observent, we practice telling our story, our positive personal narrative.\n* Observe, don't judge. Emotions are momentary, they don't embody the whole story about us.\n* Get comfortable with your emotions.\n* Retreat: Not margaritas on the beach. Specific time to focus on deeper questions about your work or life - solitary.\n* Be screenfree if possible.\n* Focus on specific questions, map out yearly goals and sit with it for a couple days.\n* _This closely maps to [GTD's][2782-004] levels of review_\n* Big-picture thinking.\n* We are imperfect being and we get snagged sometimes. \n* How do you know when you need help: \n\t* When you have significant sleep disruption for extended period\n\t* When you cross the line.\n\t* Prolonged inability to focus or shift your thoughts.\n\t* \"I am just not myself\" that stays with you for a while.\n\t* Apathy, sadness or flat mood lasting several weeks\n\t* Thoughts of self-harm or disregard for personal safety\n\n_Of note: It was difficult to keep dry eyes at the end of this talk.

We tried Steam like a year ago. Budgeting in a game. When they do flash sales (wouldn't normally do), they think it's a trial. Numbers are unbelievable. Was worried about support, but it was total impulse purchases so no increased load.\n* \"We recur with our major upgrades\" Every 18 months to two years. The bad thing: you end up holding features for upgrades.\n* Working on moving to a SaaS model.\n* I spent $65k to build a version I could put on the Mac platform (in Java). It was a disaster.

Discovery: A lot of doctors were customers - using it to create notes and templates, saving three hours per day.\n* How difficult is it to get started with our product? Discovery: Was way too technical and difficult.\n* What specific benefits are getting from using it? Discovery: Being able to spend weekends with family instead of doing notes, avoid getting sued.\n* Collect all them and make them useful.\n* Redesign the software and redoing the marketing portal. Remove technical detail and make the process of getting started very easy.\n* How to resonate with your audience: This was something made just for them.\n* Use the words your customers use to describe their problems and benefits for your marketing.\n* Big jump without paid advertising, just with a mindset change.\n* Was very worried about talking to customers, turned out they were very happy to talk, share the problems they were having.\n* It's the best time I've spent to grow my business.\n\n## Sales calls don't need to be painful\n\n**Presenter:** [Harry Hollander](https://www.twitter.com/harryhollander)\n\n* Kitchen countertop installation software\n* Talk on the phone with all customers and prospects\n* Not a salesman, but it's so incredibly valuable to their company.

It's obvious what the next step should be. It's more expensive to not use our software than to buy it.\n* Schedule support ahead of time. It's a trick, gives them time set aside to set up the product.\n* To get better: Role playing (super cheesy, but better to practice on coworkers than people who might give you money), listen to calls (painful to listen to yourself screw up on the phone, but the good parts keep getting better), write down the entire process (anticipate answers to customer's questions.\n* Important thing: Let them do the talking.\n* Key thing: repeatable sales process\n* Had a black hole of followup, painful and demoralizing.

Anything to help people. Don't take business advice from me.\n\n1. Which marketing channels are your unsung heroes?\n\t* Last-click attribution = all the credit goes to the last refer, doesn't matter what got them to that point. Don't sue it.\n\t* Multi-click attribution = gives equal allocation to each channel (social, organic, email, CPC) that user went through. So you can tell which channels are actually effective.\n\t* Assisted Conversions Report in Google Analytics (under Conversions > Multi-Channel Funnels). Last click or Direct Conversion value is last-click attribution.\n\t* If you have ecommerce tracking, deselect goals - they muddy the water. Bump the lookback date range to 90 days. API doesn't have the ability to change this lookback date range, limited to 30 days. Use the interface.\n\t* Social revenue almost always under reports in last-click\n\t* <http://bit.ly/ga-campaign-tagging>, skip to the \"Fixing Your Default Channel grouping\" section of the guide. Need to adjust campaign tracking.\n\t* Caveat: Multichannel funnels are not the same thing as the standard funnels.\n\t* Direct didn't get credit for last-click. With MCF it does get attribution. Its the main reasonMCF is its own little ecosystem.\n2. Where do your best links come from?\n\t* There are no standard reports for the job. Custom report instead.\n\t* The standard reports aren't Google Analytics. They're templates. Rely more on custom reports.\n\t* Using \"Full referrer\" dimension. Some sources don't have a full URL (Facebook, Youtube, inbound.org). If you need to know, tag the links.\n\t* <http://bit.ly/referring-urls>\n\t* <http://bit.ly/api-help>\n\t* <http://bit.ly/custom-ga-reports>\n3. What do visitors to your site search for?\n\t* Site search is your visitors' wishlist.\n\t* There is gold in these hills.\n\t* More sophisticated visitors use search.\n\t* Search terms report in GA. \n\t* Do a search on your site. Need to be fullpage, not AJAX with a url. Note the query parameter. Admin > View, Site search settings, drop in query parameter, strip query parameters out of URL\n4. How many pages does it take to convert?\n\t* You can find days/visits to conversions (Conversions > Time to conversion). Not a standard way to find out how many pages a person has to drill through the site to convert.\n\t* Apply an advanced segment. Builtin > Visits with transactions, close out all visits. That way you just have visits with conversions.\n\t* Then go to engagement to see how many pages it takes to convert.\n\t* Might have an issue is if it takes 37 pages to convert.This isn't high user engagement if you have a 0.02 conversion rate.\n5. Should you consider going responsive?\n\t* Device Category > Landing Page\n\t* Then you can see bounce rate, revenue, conversion rate per mobile/tablet/desktop\n6. Are you tagging all of your email?\n\t* Desktop apps don't pass referrer data (i.e.. Outlook, Mail.app)\n\t* Secure webmail providers don't pass referrer data\n\t* Mobile doesn't pass very much/most data\n\t* If you don't tag, it shows up as direct.\n7. Which product categories convert?\n\t* Conversion by product category\n8. Should your site go multi-lingual/national?\n\t* Check visitor countries and browser languages\n\t* <http://bit.ly/language-codes>\n9. Which competitors are stalking you?\n\t* Network domain is the domain name of the registered service provider (ISPs). Larger orgs show up as own ISP.\n\t* Can also check for .gov/.edu visits.\n\t* Them group them with a segment, then stalk your stalkers\n10. Are sites scraping your site?\n\t* Hostname report. Shows you all domains that have your GA tracking code. Scrapers aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, they leave that code in there.\n* <http://bit.ly/microconf-bundle>\n\n# Q&A\n\n* Search for brand, registers as organic, how to differentiate? Before not provided, you could set up a rule to change that to direct, but now you can't because \"not provided\" means you don't know what they searched for necessarily.\n* How to get the original tweet from the t.co link? You should be tagging social links. Twitter used to show up as direct, then Twitter added a wrapper around all links. Check the full referral report, you'll get the link.

With developers, once you hook them on benefits, then you need to sell them on your features. Anybody can make up a list of benefits; prove it. Show in exacting detail how you solution solves the problem they have.\n* A developer wants to know, does this thing solve my problem? And they need to find out as soon as possible. Because, lazy.\n* Six minute video of <http://railskits.com>, walks through the exact steps on how you can use it. High engagement, gets watched a ton (97% play rate), 15.5 hours of people watching video. ~30% make it all the way through.\n* Might be documentation rather than a video - down to the method level. Is this code really good and how can I tell if I can't see it?\n* You'll find that those docs will help devs determine if this will solve their problems.\n* Bonus: makes you more discoverable.\n* Impatience: Make it very easy for devs to figure out if it will solve the problem.\n\t* How long does it take to try?\n\t* Do I need to get permission? We don't ask for a credit card upfront. We're selling to devs on a team, they don't have access to a card. Get them into the system and then they can back up for the card.\n* Hubris: Convince them that their time is money. \n\t* Can I build this myself?\n\t* How long will it take?\n\t* Will this really save me time, or am I going to spend as much time integrating this as I would building my own?\n\t* Every developer has valued their time at zero at some point. Developers aren't economists. I won't give you $9.99, but I'll spend two weeks building my own.\n\t* Educate them on how much time/difficulty you spent on it and that their time is worth money.\n* Target their psychology and then you can sell to them.\n\n## The five most depressing facts of selling to consumers\n\n**Presenter:** [Jordan Sherer](https://www.twitter.com/widefido)\n\n* <https://mnmlrdr.com/>\n* Nobody tells you how to sell software to consumers\n* First product: One-time purchase, downloadable, Windows-only, shareware to-do app\n* Five deadly sins of MicroConf, but was able to quit his job last year\n* Selling to consumers is like selling to crowd.\n* What's so bad? \n\t* Consumers don't know that they have a problem\n\t* Or they don't want to admit\n\t* So they're not looking for a solution\n* First step is you have to find a way to reach them. Broadcast mediums work great, but you need to find a way to reach them online. You need to teach them that they have the problem, that you have a solution to that problem and they should pay you for that solution. Then, that other people they know might have the same problem.\n* Consumer don't want to pay you every month. (or actually, at all)\n* Free! (doesn't make any sense)\n* Ads! (have to have a large enough audience to make that work)\n* Freemium! (really have to convert a lot of people to make a lot of money)\n* Lean toward free trials.\n* It's good to have a source of revenue, but they don't want to pay you.\n* You don't have enough margin to look at paid acquisition\n* \"I would never pay you $4, but I might be convinced to pay you $2\"\n* \"While $4 isn't much, it's $3 more than I'm willing to spend.\"\n* They can't see the problem. They don't value the solution.\n* Show instead of tell. Show them everything: this is what you're getting, this is _why_ you need it.\n* Consumers spend very little money on software (with some exceptions: entertainment, mobile)\n* King makes $1.5 mil _per day_\n* Consumers are fuzzy creatures with _feelings_\n* Consumers are wetware. We purchase things because they make us feel good inside. Your product makes me feel better about myself.\n* Make them feel comfortable. Can't surprise them, make them feel safe, secure.\n* You _can_ succeed in B2C, but prepare to work harder.\n* Avoid free and experimental business models. Stick to freemium, free trials.\n* Target an audience that will sell for you. Viral loops.\n* Sell at the highest possible price (which is low, because they don't want to pay you)\n* So keep costs as low as possible.\n* Build entertainment into your product.\n* Automate _everything_.\n* Hand-hold when you need to (see: fuzzy creatures)\n* Don't ignore B2B opportunities, you can shift later (Dropbox, for instance)\n\n## Inside Gumroad Data\n\n**Presenter:** [Ryan Delk](https://www.twitter.com/delk)\n\n* Data to go from ideation to launch\n1. Pricing\n\t* Always tier your pricing. This works really, really for driving additional revenue. Hardest part is what tiers should be: 1X, 2.2X, 5X perform best. Make sure you have significant difference between tiers. 5X is actually on the low side. Sellers make 5X more revenue when tiered. 62% of revenue comes from the top tier plan.\n2. Pre Sales\n\t* Emails are gold. Important to build a list just for the product.\n\t* Incentivize. Provide value in exchange for the email address.\n\t* Dedicated email lists work. 3x more revenue.\n\t* <http://sachagrief.com> \"Discover Meteor\", dedicated list. 15% conversion from his email list. Average purchase was > $65 (double the non-email average). Revenue per subscriber was > $9\n3.

They're blunt, aloof, crass from time to time.\n\nNow, a lot of stereotypes exist for a reason, and there are indeed developers out there that match what I just described.\n\nAnd you don't want to hire them.\n\nA majority of developers have some of that stereotype in there, but that comes more into play once you have them on-board and you need to manage them. \n\nFrom a hiring perspective, the best developers you'll ever hire are more than that stereotype. \n\nThe best you can ever hire are collaborative, not loners.\n\nThey're communicative, not headphones-on and tuned-out.\n\nAnd most of all: They care about things other than code.\n\nThese short vignettes are more specific developer steroetypes, including advice on how to spot and hire them (or, in many cases, to not hire them).\n\n\n### The Brogrammer\n\nSeemingly native to Silicon Valley, the Brogrammer remains an emerging developer stereotype. Young, dumb, easily plied with alcohol and sexism, the Brogrammer is like a frat boy who happens to pound Red Bull and crush code, bro.\n\n#### Your Brogrammer Field Spotting Guide\n\n* Piles of the aforementioned Red Bull\n* Privileged\n* A font of misogyny\n* Seriously, think frat house\n* Quite possibly very, very good at code\n\n#### Where to find a Brogrammer\n\n* Hooker-themed parties for developers\n* At some startup somewhere that has no chance of succeeding\n* Again, at a frat house\n* [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)\n\n#### Hiring advice\n\nAgain, no.\n\nNow listen, I'm fairly certain that a lot of brogrammers are good at code; it'd be hard to get away with the stereotypical behavior if not.\n\nBut, if there's one thing I'm able to teach you, it's that your goal is to have a great *team*, not a collection of great individuals.\n\nEven more than that: you want to hire good people who can meld together into a coherent team.\n\nUnless you're going to be hiring nothing but brogrammers, even one in the mix is going to upset the entire apple cart.\n\nBecause, no matter how good their code is, they can be looked upon with scorn and derision. And, given the inherent privilege and sense of entitlement that comes with the stereotype, they're going to be short-timers.\n\nPart of the skill to hiring, in my view, is to hire such that you don't need to do it often. If you have developers coming through as if your company is a revolving door then either you're hiring the wrong people or you're managing them poorly.

But there might be times and circumstances where you find a pair of more junior-level hires instead. And maybe that makes sense. Or you might find a heavy-duty frontend developer with some light backend chops when you're looking for a backend person to complete a particular upcoming project.\n\n\tThe key is to think more about how a possible hire fits in with the atmosphere and general workflow of your company than it sometimes is to fill a specific need.\n\n\tIt might be the old sportswriter in me, but in general my philosophy reminds me the philosophy some NFL teams have when it comes to their annual draft: Draft the best available, regardless of position.\n\n\tAnd, for me at least, that's generally how I look at hiring: I try to hire the best available, even if they may not be a perfect fit for the particular need I had in mind when I started the hiring process.\n\n\tI've hired more senior guys when I went looking for junior-level candidates. I've also hired frontend guys with a wee bit of backend when I've gone looking for backend talent.\n\n\tThe key in all circumstances is that you take the long view on a hire. What you're hiring for right this second - whatever pressing need you're trying to fill - might not be a pressing need in a few month's time.\n\n\tEven more importantly, the developer you hire today will not be the same developer you're employing six months or a year from now. The name badge will have the same name, but the work they do for you and the atmosphere you surround them with will change them along the way, hopefully for the better.\n\n\tDevelopers grow and change along the way, largely because programming is more craft than skill.

Some realize this, some don't, but it's a fact.\n\n\tAs such, unless you're Google, or Twitter, or Facebook or some such, by and large working at your company, from a developer's perspective, is not a privilege. In a way, it's a favor to you.\n\n\tKeep this in mind when hiring. The less hoops you make a developer jump through and the more you can make them feel appreciated and wanted, the better success rate you're going to see.\n\n\tAnd, yes, I realize this just devolved into relationship advice, but some truths are universal.\n\n3. **Be curious:** When I was on the other end of the hiring scenario - interviewing for jobs - I had my best success when I went into an interview thinking not of how to land the job, but more about what I can learn from the experience.\n\n\tAnd it’s the same now that I’m on the other side.

Those efforts weren't going all that well, but the content I produced for it I'm particularly proud of.\n\nThe section below is a slightly modified chunk of what was to be [\"The Technical Recruiter's Guide to Ruby\"](https://www.techrecruiterguides.com/products/ruby/). It remains written with a recruiter audience in mind, but if you hire Ruby programmers, almost all the advice and information applies widely.\n\nEnjoy. And [let me know](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com) of anything you've found particularly effective that I've neglected to mention.\n\n<h3>Online</h3>\n\n<h4>LinkedIn</h4>\n\n<p>This chapter is about where developers hang out and then we leap directly into <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>, a place most developers loathe.</p>\n\n<p>They get inundated with recruiter spam (no offense) and nonsensical connection requests all the time, sure, but at this point even they know that LinkedIn is the preeminent place to highlight your resume and look for a job in a passive manner.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the thing: LinkedIn is made for passive job hunting. You post your details and let it sit there. And every once in a while an interesting job offer inquiry will come across.</p>\n\n<p>This is where you come in, by the way.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fact of modern internet life that most developers, no matter how begrudgingly, will have a profile there, including Ruby developers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> As actual job ads, sure. But don&#8217;t go polluting specific groups or the like. <strong>Cost?</strong> Varies. At the moment, for me, it looks like $195 for a 30-day posting.</p>\n\n<h4>GitHub</h4>\n\n<p>The grand poobah of social coding, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> is the definition of &#8220;where developers hang out.&#8221; And that&#8217;s especially true of Rubyists. After all, GitHub was built by Rubyists and is still largely built with Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>The tricky thing is that, unlike LinkedIn, GitHub is focused on projects, not people.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use the <a href=\"https://github.com/search/advanced\">advanced search</a> to just spit out users in a particular location (here&#8217;s all the <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=location%3AIndianapolis+location%3AIN&amp;type=Users&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;l=\">Indianapolis users</a>). From there, you can further filter by programming language.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to be a bit more laborious than LinkedIn since we&#8217;re looking at projects rather than people, but you can click through a bit and find interesting projects and then follow them through both the owner of the project and the contributors.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, one of the big benefits to GitHub is that you can see code. So, you can find out ahead of time if their code skills and style match your client&#8217;s expectations. </p>\n\n<p>The other bonus is that a surprising number of GitHub profiles include both location and email address.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Not directly, but GitHub does run a very successful <a href=\"https://jobs.github.com/\">job board</a>. <strong>Cost?</strong> $450 for a 30-day listing.</p>\n\n<h4>StackOverflow</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">StackOverflow</a> is the standard place programmers go when they&#8217;re stuck. Its Q&amp;A format makes it a repository of answers to almost everything and its ranking system incentivizes developers to provide answers to any questions other developers might have.</p>\n\n<p>It has such a tremendous amount of developer cachet at this point that it also manages <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">a job board</a> of sorts, including developer profiles (here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/chrisvannoy\">mine</a> as an example).</p>\n\n<p>The problem with all that cachet, is that, likely knowing just how much developers tend to hate recruiters (again, no offense), the Careers 2.0 site&#8217;s searchable candidate database requires a hefty minimum of $1,000/month to use.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re reading this and you run a recruiting service or you work at a large enough company that you&#8217;re hiring developers over and over and over again, then that price tag might be a good idea. After all, there are few sites out there that will feature a richer pool of developer talent.</p>\n\n<p>If the price tag is too steep, what you&#8217;re left with instead is the ability to narrow the users of SO down by tag &#8230; and not much else.</p>\n\n<p>You can pick a tag or search and then see the top users for that tag. For instance, here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/ruby/topusers\">the leaderboard for ruby</a> posts. From there, you can find which users have answered the most questions both in the last 30 days and all time.</p>\n\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re hiring remote users and care only about hiring the absolute best, you might find that useful.</p>\n\n<p>There is no good way to limit the lists of users by geography, so if you&#8217;re looking for someone local, you&#8217;re pretty much reduced to needle in a haystack territory.</p>\n\n<p>What you can do is to basically take their username and then hope they either used their real name or use that same username in lots of other places that are indexed by Google so you can track them down.</p>\n\n<p>Your mileage may obviously vary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> In the <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Careers section</a>, obviously. However, not in the general flow of the site; that&#8217;ll get you banned quickly. <strong>Cost?</strong> For a one-off, $350 for a 30-day listing. They do offer <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/products/listings\">volume discounts</a>, however.</p>\n\n<h4>Workingwithrails.com</h4>\n\n<p>A bit more Rails-centric than Ruby in general, <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/\">workingwithrails.com</a> includes a <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/people\">list of Railsians</a>, which means they&#8217;re Rubyists as well.</p>\n\n<p>The search on that list will search any location included in the profile, so you can <em>maybe</em> narrow things down.</p>\n\n<p>An important note, though: This site was quite popular in the early days of Rails, but many folks would enter their data once and promptly forget about it.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/people/151134\">my own profile</a> is two jobs out of date.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t trust the site as a primary source of information, but rather as a starting point for further research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Yep. They have a <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/jobs\">job board</a> that even has recent postings. That said, given the above, it&#8217;s not frequently accessed, so there are better avenues to explore - especially since it also requires a Rails focus for postings. The one key benefit: It&#8217;s free. <strong>Cost?</strong> Free</p>\n\n<h4>Other job boards</h4>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve already mentioned a handful above, but here are a few more in capsule form:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/\">We Work Remotely</a>:</strong> Formerly a job board tied to <a href=\"https://37signals.com/\">37Signals</a>, the creators of Ruby on Rails, We Work Remotely now houses job ads that are solely for remote work. Given the Rubyist pedigree, it remains a good spot - especially if your client is hiring remotely. <strong>Cost?</strong> $200 for a 30-day ad.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/\">Authentic Jobs</a>:</strong> One of the first independent developer/designer job boards, Authentic Jobs is still going strong. In the past it has had more of a designery bent, but it&#8217;s considerably <a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/#search=ruby\">more than that</a> these days. <strong>Cost?</strong> $249 for a 30-day ad.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://jobs.rubynow.com/\">Ruby Now</a>:</strong> Ruby Now has an interesting approach - including job ad advice at the <a href=\"http://jobs.rubynow.com/post/jobs/new\">premium level</a> and a direct email to an opt-in list (2,500+ according to them) at both levels. <strong>Cost?</strong> $195-$99 for a 45-day ad.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Mailing lists and forums</h4>\n\n<p>Rubyists (and open source software developers in general) are a yackety bunch. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ruby-forum.com/\">Ruby-forum.com</a> houses archives and mirrors of a slew of mainline Ruby-related mailing lists.</p>\n\n<p>Most individual projects will also have their own mailing lists, so if you&#8217;re after knowledge of a specific library, that will likely be a better bet. Most of the time, you&#8217;ll find links to these lists on the project&#8217;s home page or GitHub repository.</p>\n\n<p>In general, you&#8217;re going to find a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the posts to lists are going to be questions from new users to the language/library or very esoteric topics that you&#8217;re not going to be that interested in.</p>\n\n<p>What they can be good for, though, is just soaking in the community a bit. After a while, you should have a better grasp of the personalities and problems involved, which can come in handy later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Nope. But you can track down a participant who seems interesting later, either through their name/username or their email address. Bonus: You have their email address.</p>\n\n<h5>Ruby Weekly</h5>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve singled <a href=\"http://rubyweekly.com/\">Ruby Weekly</a> out because it&#8217;s a specifically great place to post a job ad.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s subscriber list (at the time of this writing) approaches 28,000 Rubyists. There are that many subscribed because it does a fantastic job of highlighting the newest trends, libraries and other things in the Ruby ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>As such: it gets not just subscribed to, but <em>read</em>. And read by some of the best Rubyists you&#8217;ll find.</p>\n\n<p>And with job ads running just <a href=\"https://cooperpress.com/jobs\">$129 a pop</a>, it&#8217;s a fantastic deal as well.</p>\n\n<h4>Meetups</h4>\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s my personal favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby developers <em>love</em> their meetups. And any city of particular size is likely to have their own. So, find them.</p>\n\n<p>Things work better if you&#8217;re an active participant in the meetup, and even better if you host or sponsor it. In a pinch, though, you can get by without either.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you do:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Head on over to <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Plug your search term, preferably fairly broad into the search box.</li>\n<li>Expand the scope out to 100 miles or so.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the search results for <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=ruby&amp;radius=100&amp;userFreeform=Indianapolis%2C+IN&amp;mcId=z46201&amp;mcName=Indianapolis%2C+IN&amp;sort=default\">Indianapolis Ruby meetups</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right off the bat, I now have a list of roughly 450 Ruby developers in the Indy area just from the Indy.rb group. And I know that list of developers includes, by default, people who care enough about the language to at least be interested in meeting like-minded individuals in their free time from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Even better, almost all meetups keep a public list of members. Here&#8217;s the list for <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/members/\">Indy.rb</a> (I&#8217;m even <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/members/11201351/\">in there</a>). You typically get photos, a brief bio and most importantly, a name.</p>\n\n<p>And once you find a few that look interesting, you can plug that name into Google or your search engine of choice and get a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned attending the meet up a bit earlier, and I&#8217;d highly recommend that in general. The more plugged in with a community you are, the more people you will know and the more people will be willing to help you when it does become time to hire. </p>\n\n<p>Being absorbed into a community of developers, even if you aren&#8217;t one, can help immensely in being able to pick out the good from the bad.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, you might get some funny looks from time to time. But show up, be curious and interested and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows, you might pick up a trick or two.</p>\n\n<h5>More specific Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts</h5>\n\n<p>A few extra tips about attending meetups as a non-technical person looking to hire:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attend regularly (or at least more than once):</strong> Before you go slinging job inquiries around, ingratiate yourself with the community. Lurk at least for the first go around. Everyone knows why you&#8217;re there, but you&#8217;ll need them to kind of know who you are before you can start that type of dialogue.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice standard chit-chat:</strong> Related to the above, try to just talk for a while. Ask about what they&#8217;re working on, for instance.</li>\n<li><strong>Bribe them:</strong> Kind of a no-brainer, but buy the pizza or a round afterward can quicken the process a good bit. Another good route: Donating books around the group&#8217;s topic to be given away. Bonus, kinda sneaky addition: Throw your business card in the book.</li>\n<li><strong>Be curious:</strong> Most of all, soak in the topics discussed and the environment around the room. Ask questions. Be involved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Nope. That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re there for. You can generally sponsor (or have your client sponsor) the food/drinks at meetups, though.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n\n<p>We mentioned meetups a bit earlier, but if there&#8217;s one thing Rubyists enjoy more than meetups, it&#8217;s conferences.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see at <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby/\">Lanyrd</a>, there are a ton of Ruby-specific conferences scheduled world wide.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://rubyconf.org/\">RubyConf</a>:</strong> Generally held in the fall, is the primary conference for Rubyists. Its location tends to rotate around the US every year.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The International Ruby Conference &#8211; more commonly known as RubyConf &#8211; has been the main annual gathering of Rubyists from around the world since 2001. Focused on fostering the Ruby programming language and the robust community that has sprung up around it, RubyConf brings together Rubyists both established and new to discuss emerging ideas, collaborate, and socialize in some of the best locations in the US.<a href=\"#fn:1\" id=\"fnref:1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It runs more than 1,300 attendees on average and sells out quickly (typically in hours).</p>\n\n<p>Sponsorship packages are available and run in the 10s of thousands, but there are few better ways to get a major client&#8217;s name in front of a ton of Ruby developers.</p>\n\n<p>If that&#8217;s too rich for your blood, if you attend the conference you will typically find a big whiteboard board or giant sheet of paper that&#8217;s free to post job ads onto. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, below is one of the boards from RailsConf 2012<a href=\"#fn:2\" id=\"fnref:2\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[2]</a>:</p>\n\n![](http://pragmaticstudio.com/images/blog/railsconf2012-job-board.jpg)\n\n\n<p>The trick with these is to make sure you include your client&#8217;s name (if you can) and a contact email address or a short, memorable URL. Throw in a perk or two (or, to use a marketing term, your value proposition) if you have the room. A different, unique (but readable) dry erase marker color might also come in handy.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I suggest your client name rather than a generic &#8220;We hire Rubyists&#8221; sort of message is that the vast majority of job ads posted on these will be direct hire opportunities - companies send developers and those developers post the job ads themselves. It&#8217;s always going to be more effective - but especially in this environment - to mention the client you&#8217;re working for.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://railsconf.com/\">RailsConf</a>:</strong> Held in the spring (typically April), RailsConf concentrates on Ruby&#8217;s preeminent framework. However, the session track will normally cover more mainline Ruby topics of well. For instance, the 2014 program includes a session on specifically building web apps in Ruby without using Rails.\n\n<p>And, as I mentioned above, most Ruby jobs can more properly be described as Rails jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Attendance is typically 1,500+ and like RubyConf, it sells out quickly each and every year.</p>\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t believe a conference is a smart place to advertise openings, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.railsconf.com/sponsors\">the lead sponsor for 2014</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Regional Conferences:</strong> Almost any area with a significant environment of Ruby developers is going to have a conference of their own. Just check Lanyrd and find one near you.\n\n<p>Sponsorship and attendance cost will likely be significantly cheaper and you&#8217;ll be able to hone in geographically as well.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://rubyconf.org/about\">http://rubyconf.org/about</a>  <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\n<p>Original source: <a href=\"https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2012/4/30/job-boards-at-railsconf\">https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2012/4/30/job-boards-at-railsconf</a> <a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>","html":"<p>I'm taking a break from trying to create books and products and things.

At the moment, for me, it looks like $195 for a 30-day posting.</p>\n\n<h4>GitHub</h4>\n\n<p>The grand poobah of social coding, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> is the definition of &#8220;where developers hang out.&#8221; And that&#8217;s especially true of Rubyists. After all, GitHub was built by Rubyists and is still largely built with Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>The tricky thing is that, unlike LinkedIn, GitHub is focused on projects, not people.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use the <a href=\"https://github.com/search/advanced\">advanced search</a> to just spit out users in a particular location (here&#8217;s all the <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=location%3AIndianapolis+location%3AIN&amp;type=Users&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;l=\">Indianapolis users</a>). From there, you can further filter by programming language.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to be a bit more laborious than LinkedIn since we&#8217;re looking at projects rather than people, but you can click through a bit and find interesting projects and then follow them through both the owner of the project and the contributors.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, one of the big benefits to GitHub is that you can see code. So, you can find out ahead of time if their code skills and style match your client&#8217;s expectations. </p>\n\n<p>The other bonus is that a surprising number of GitHub profiles include both location and email address.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Not directly, but GitHub does run a very successful <a href=\"https://jobs.github.com/\">job board</a>. <strong>Cost?</strong> $450 for a 30-day listing.</p>\n\n<h4>StackOverflow</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\">StackOverflow</a> is the standard place programmers go when they&#8217;re stuck. Its Q&amp;A format makes it a repository of answers to almost everything and its ranking system incentivizes developers to provide answers to any questions other developers might have.</p>\n\n<p>It has such a tremendous amount of developer cachet at this point that it also manages <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">a job board</a> of sorts, including developer profiles (here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/chrisvannoy\">mine</a> as an example).</p>\n\n<p>The problem with all that cachet, is that, likely knowing just how much developers tend to hate recruiters (again, no offense), the Careers 2.0 site&#8217;s searchable candidate database requires a hefty minimum of $1,000/month to use.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re reading this and you run a recruiting service or you work at a large enough company that you&#8217;re hiring developers over and over and over again, then that price tag might be a good idea. After all, there are few sites out there that will feature a richer pool of developer talent.</p>\n\n<p>If the price tag is too steep, what you&#8217;re left with instead is the ability to narrow the users of SO down by tag &#8230; and not much else.</p>\n\n<p>You can pick a tag or search and then see the top users for that tag. For instance, here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/ruby/topusers\">the leaderboard for ruby</a> posts. From there, you can find which users have answered the most questions both in the last 30 days and all time.</p>\n\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re hiring remote users and care only about hiring the absolute best, you might find that useful.</p>\n\n<p>There is no good way to limit the lists of users by geography, so if you&#8217;re looking for someone local, you&#8217;re pretty much reduced to needle in a haystack territory.</p>\n\n<p>What you can do is to basically take their username and then hope they either used their real name or use that same username in lots of other places that are indexed by Google so you can track them down.</p>\n\n<p>Your mileage may obviously vary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> In the <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/\">Careers section</a>, obviously. However, not in the general flow of the site; that&#8217;ll get you banned quickly. <strong>Cost?</strong> For a one-off, $350 for a 30-day listing. They do offer <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/products/listings\">volume discounts</a>, however.</p>\n\n<h4>Workingwithrails.com</h4>\n\n<p>A bit more Rails-centric than Ruby in general, <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/\">workingwithrails.com</a> includes a <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/browse/people\">list of Railsians</a>, which means they&#8217;re Rubyists as well.</p>\n\n<p>The search on that list will search any location included in the profile, so you can <em>maybe</em> narrow things down.</p>\n\n<p>An important note, though: This site was quite popular in the early days of Rails, but many folks would enter their data once and promptly forget about it.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/people/151134\">my own profile</a> is two jobs out of date.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t trust the site as a primary source of information, but rather as a starting point for further research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Yep. They have a <a href=\"http://www.workingwithrails.com/jobs\">job board</a> that even has recent postings. That said, given the above, it&#8217;s not frequently accessed, so there are better avenues to explore - especially since it also requires a Rails focus for postings. The one key benefit: It&#8217;s free. <strong>Cost?</strong> Free</p>\n\n<h4>Other job boards</h4>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve already mentioned a handful above, but here are a few more in capsule form:</p>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><strong><a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/\">We Work Remotely</a>:</strong> Formerly a job board tied to <a href=\"https://37signals.com/\">37Signals</a>, the creators of Ruby on Rails, We Work Remotely now houses job ads that are solely for remote work. Given the Rubyist pedigree, it remains a good spot - especially if your client is hiring remotely. <strong>Cost?</strong> $200 for a 30-day ad.</li>  \n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/\">Authentic Jobs</a>:</strong> One of the first independent developer/designer job boards, Authentic Jobs is still going strong. In the past it has had more of a designery bent, but it&#8217;s considerably <a href=\"http://www.authenticjobs.com/#search=ruby\">more than that</a> these days. <strong>Cost?</strong> $249 for a 30-day ad.</li>  \n<li><strong><a href=\"http://jobs.rubynow.com/\">Ruby Now</a>:</strong> Ruby Now has an interesting approach - including job ad advice at the <a href=\"http://jobs.rubynow.com/post/jobs/new\">premium level</a> and a direct email to an opt-in list (2,500+ according to them) at both levels. <strong>Cost?</strong> $195-$99 for a 45-day ad.</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<h4>Mailing lists and forums</h4>\n\n<p>Rubyists (and open source software developers in general) are a yackety bunch. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ruby-forum.com/\">Ruby-forum.com</a> houses archives and mirrors of a slew of mainline Ruby-related mailing lists.</p>\n\n<p>Most individual projects will also have their own mailing lists, so if you&#8217;re after knowledge of a specific library, that will likely be a better bet. Most of the time, you&#8217;ll find links to these lists on the project&#8217;s home page or GitHub repository.</p>\n\n<p>In general, you&#8217;re going to find a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the posts to lists are going to be questions from new users to the language/library or very esoteric topics that you&#8217;re not going to be that interested in.</p>\n\n<p>What they can be good for, though, is just soaking in the community a bit. After a while, you should have a better grasp of the personalities and problems involved, which can come in handy later.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Nope. But you can track down a participant who seems interesting later, either through their name/username or their email address. Bonus: You have their email address.</p>\n\n<h5>Ruby Weekly</h5>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve singled <a href=\"http://rubyweekly.com/\">Ruby Weekly</a> out because it&#8217;s a specifically great place to post a job ad.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s subscriber list (at the time of this writing) approaches 28,000 Rubyists. There are that many subscribed because it does a fantastic job of highlighting the newest trends, libraries and other things in the Ruby ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>As such: it gets not just subscribed to, but <em>read</em>. And read by some of the best Rubyists you&#8217;ll find.</p>\n\n<p>And with job ads running just <a href=\"https://cooperpress.com/jobs\">$129 a pop</a>, it&#8217;s a fantastic deal as well.</p>\n\n<h4>Meetups</h4>\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s my personal favorite.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby developers <em>love</em> their meetups. And any city of particular size is likely to have their own. So, find them.</p>\n\n<p>Things work better if you&#8217;re an active participant in the meetup, and even better if you host or sponsor it. In a pinch, though, you can get by without either.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you do:</p>\n\n<ol>  \n<li>Head on over to <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a>.</li>  \n<li>Plug your search term, preferably fairly broad into the search box.</li>  \n<li>Expand the scope out to 100 miles or so.</li>  \n</ol>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the search results for <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=ruby&amp;radius=100&amp;userFreeform=Indianapolis%2C+IN&amp;mcId=z46201&amp;mcName=Indianapolis%2C+IN&amp;sort=default\">Indianapolis Ruby meetups</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right off the bat, I now have a list of roughly 450 Ruby developers in the Indy area just from the Indy.rb group. And I know that list of developers includes, by default, people who care enough about the language to at least be interested in meeting like-minded individuals in their free time from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>Even better, almost all meetups keep a public list of members. Here&#8217;s the list for <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/members/\">Indy.rb</a> (I&#8217;m even <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/indyrb/members/11201351/\">in there</a>). You typically get photos, a brief bio and most importantly, a name.</p>\n\n<p>And once you find a few that look interesting, you can plug that name into Google or your search engine of choice and get a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned attending the meet up a bit earlier, and I&#8217;d highly recommend that in general. The more plugged in with a community you are, the more people you will know and the more people will be willing to help you when it does become time to hire. </p>\n\n<p>Being absorbed into a community of developers, even if you aren&#8217;t one, can help immensely in being able to pick out the good from the bad.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, you might get some funny looks from time to time. But show up, be curious and interested and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Who knows, you might pick up a trick or two.</p>\n\n<h5>More specific Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts</h5>\n\n<p>A few extra tips about attending meetups as a non-technical person looking to hire:</p>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Attend regularly (or at least more than once):</strong> Before you go slinging job inquiries around, ingratiate yourself with the community. Lurk at least for the first go around. Everyone knows why you&#8217;re there, but you&#8217;ll need them to kind of know who you are before you can start that type of dialogue.</li>  \n<li><strong>Practice standard chit-chat:</strong> Related to the above, try to just talk for a while. Ask about what they&#8217;re working on, for instance.</li>  \n<li><strong>Bribe them:</strong> Kind of a no-brainer, but buy the pizza or a round afterward can quicken the process a good bit. Another good route: Donating books around the group&#8217;s topic to be given away. Bonus, kinda sneaky addition: Throw your business card in the book.</li>  \n<li><strong>Be curious:</strong> Most of all, soak in the topics discussed and the environment around the room. Ask questions. Be involved.</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Can you post job ads?</strong> Nope. That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re there for. You can generally sponsor (or have your client sponsor) the food/drinks at meetups, though.</p>\n\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n\n<p>We mentioned meetups a bit earlier, but if there&#8217;s one thing Rubyists enjoy more than meetups, it&#8217;s conferences.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see at <a href=\"http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby/\">Lanyrd</a>, there are a ton of Ruby-specific conferences scheduled world wide.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest include:</p>\n\n<ul>  \n<li><p><strong><a href=\"http://rubyconf.org/\">RubyConf</a>:</strong> Generally held in the fall, is the primary conference for Rubyists. Its location tends to rotate around the US every year.</p>\n\n<blockquote>  \n<p>The International Ruby Conference &#8211; more commonly known as RubyConf &#8211; has been the main annual gathering of Rubyists from around the world since 2001. Focused on fostering the Ruby programming language and the robust community that has sprung up around it, RubyConf brings together Rubyists both established and new to discuss emerging ideas, collaborate, and socialize in some of the best locations in the US.<a href=\"#fn:1\" id=\"fnref:1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]</a></p>  \n</blockquote>  \n<p>It runs more than 1,300 attendees on average and sells out quickly (typically in hours).</p>\n\n<p>Sponsorship packages are available and run in the 10s of thousands, but there are few better ways to get a major client&#8217;s name in front of a ton of Ruby developers.</p>\n\n<p>If that&#8217;s too rich for your blood, if you attend the conference you will typically find a big whiteboard board or giant sheet of paper that&#8217;s free to post job ads onto. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, below is one of the boards from RailsConf 2012<a href=\"#fn:2\" id=\"fnref:2\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[2]</a>:</p>\n\n<img src=\"http://pragmaticstudio.com/images/blog/railsconf2012-job-board.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n<p>The trick with these is to make sure you include your client&#8217;s name (if you can) and a contact email address or a short, memorable URL. Throw in a perk or two (or, to use a marketing term, your value proposition) if you have the room. A different, unique (but readable) dry erase marker color might also come in handy.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I suggest your client name rather than a generic &#8220;We hire Rubyists&#8221; sort of message is that the vast majority of job ads posted on these will be direct hire opportunities - companies send developers and those developers post the job ads themselves. It&#8217;s always going to be more effective - but especially in this environment - to mention the client you&#8217;re working for.</p>  \n</li>\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://railsconf.com/\">RailsConf</a>:</strong> Held in the spring (typically April), RailsConf concentrates on Ruby&#8217;s preeminent framework. However, the session track will normally cover more mainline Ruby topics of well. For instance, the 2014 program includes a session on specifically building web apps in Ruby without using Rails.\n\n<p>And, as I mentioned above, most Ruby jobs can more properly be described as Rails jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Attendance is typically 1,500+ and like RubyConf, it sells out quickly each and every year.</p>\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t believe a conference is a smart place to advertise openings, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.railsconf.com/sponsors\">the lead sponsor for 2014</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>  \n</li>\n\n<li><strong>Regional Conferences:</strong> Almost any area with a significant environment of Ruby developers is going to have a conference of their own. Just check Lanyrd and find one near you.\n\n<p>Sponsorship and attendance cost will likely be significantly cheaper and you&#8217;ll be able to hone in geographically as well.</p>  \n</li>  \n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">  \n<hr />  \n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn:1\">  \n<p><a href=\"http://rubyconf.org/about\">http://rubyconf.org/about</a>  <a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>  \n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn:2\">  \n<p>Original source: <a href=\"https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2012/4/30/job-boards-at-railsconf\">https://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2012/4/30/job-boards-at-railsconf</a> <a href=\"#fnref:2\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>  \n</li>\n\n</ol>  \n</div>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1409325277636,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1409325394541,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1409325284550,"published_by":1},{"id":84,"uuid":"f6b43c43-13eb-4dab-a7ea-ac58d06a316c","title":"AB Testing for time on page with Optimizely","slug":"ab-testing-for-time-on-page-with-optimizely","markdown":"Sometimes, like say if you go with a [longform landing page](http://www.groovehq.com/blog/long-form-landing-page), a metric of success is going to be just how many folks stuck around long enough to read.\n\nAfter all, if you put your call-to-action in the footer, there's no sense optimizing it if 90% of your visitors aren't on the page long enough to get there in the first place.\n\nIt's also a handy metric for AB testing your messaging and copy. Is it more engaging? Do more people actually read it? Time on page works as a nice proxy for those as well.\n\nHowever, most AB testing platforms are optimized for more tangible actions - clicks, form submissions and the like.\n\nAt the day job, we do most of our AB testing through [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com), a platform that I can (and do!) highly recommend.\n\nHere's how you would set up time on site as a goal in Optimizely; I'd imagine/hope most other platforms would be similar.\n\n1. First, you need to figure out what the threshold time you're aiming for should be. You can eyeball it, time yourself reading your copy, run your copy through any number of libraries and services (this library looks particularly interesting: <https://github.com/hswolff/read-time>) or simply divide your number of words by 200 - the average words per minute speed for an adult.\n2. Since we're going to be setting this up in javascript, You're next going to need to convert the number from No. 1 (let's call it 6 minutes) into milliseconds.\n\n\t`6 * 60 * 1000`\n\n3. Now that we have a number for the average adult's time to read your text, I'd suggest lowering it by about a quarter or third. Even your most-attentive readers are going to skim at least a little (and if they don't, all the better!). \n4. Now we're going to add a bit of code to your page (which should already have the Optimizely code on page, naturally). There are probably ways to do this directly in the Optimizely interface (in fact, I'm sure of it), but I tend to find this approach a bit cleaner.\n\n\tSomewhere in your header or footer (below the Optimizely snippet), add the following, but with your milliseconds replacing the YOUR_MILLISECONDS area:\n\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t  $(document).ready(function () {\n            window['optimizely'] = window['optimizely'] || [];\n\t\t    setTimeout(function () {\n\t\t\t  window.optimizely.push([\"trackEvent\", \"threshold\"]);\n\t\t    }, YOUR_MILLISECONDS);\n\t\t  });\n        </script>\n\n\tWhat the above block does is wait for YOUR_MILLISECONDS and then ping Optimizely with a [custom event](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039925-Custom-event-goals) called \"threshold\". That custom event can actually be called whatever you'd like, but I feel that \"threshold\" seems to fit fairly well.\n\n5. Now we're ready to set up our goal in Optimizely itself.\n\n\t![](http://cl.ly/image/0L2S3t150u3o/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-29%20at%204.22.24%20PM.png)\n\n\tCreate a new goal. Under \"What to Track,\" choose \"Custom events.\"\n\n\tIn the \"Custom Event to track\" field, enter the custom event you chose in Step 4 (\"threshold\" in the example case).\n\n\tSave that puppy and you're ready to start your experiment.\n\nFrom this point, Optimizely will track the goal like all the others. Each time a visitors sticks on the page longer than your threshold, it will count as a conversion.\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you like the above. A lot of my day job these days has been wrapped up in metric optimization and analytics.\n\nBecause I'm not quite busy enough, if you would like me to work my magic on your site - whether that's just suggesting AB tests, or implementing them, or simply digging into your analytics - do [get in touch](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com)\n\n<hr />\n\n**Update:** In case you were wondering how to do the above directly in the Optimizely interface, here's how:\n\nInstead of Step 4 above, we're going to add our javascript to the Global Javascript area in the Optimizely interface (found under \"Options\", screenshots below.\n\n![](http://cl.ly/image/2r2d2A0Y1u14/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-03%20at%204.39.12%20PM.png)\n\n![](http://cl.ly/image/2m3o3h0R1k0X/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-03%20at%204.39.33%20PM.png)\n\nSince Optimizely will wrap the code in a `<script>` tag for you, you'd paste the following in there instead:\n\n\t\t  $(document).ready(function () {\n            window['optimizely'] = window['optimizely'] || [];\n\t\t    setTimeout(function () {\n\t\t\t  window.optimizely.push([\"trackEvent\", \"threshold\"]);\n\t\t    }, YOUR_MILLISECONDS);\n\t\t  });\n\nOther than that, the procedure is exactly the same.","html":"<p>Sometimes, like say if you go with a <a href=\"http://www.groovehq.com/blog/long-form-landing-page\">longform landing page</a>, a metric of success is going to be just how many folks stuck around long enough to read.</p>\n\n<p>After all, if you put your call-to-action in the footer, there's no sense optimizing it if 90% of your visitors aren't on the page long enough to get there in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>It's also a handy metric for AB testing your messaging and copy.

Do you like it?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* An in. This question has less to do with how they’ll fit in, but much more to do with how you can get them in. You’re looking for contrast points with what you have to offer. What are their pain points and what can you sell to them. Alternatively, if they’re not complaining at all, you might have to do a lot more work later. That said: Even the happiest developer will complain about *something* if you give them a window. Use that later.\n\t\n* **What do they have you working on? How are you building that?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* A bit of the above — job dissatisfaction, but also a segue into later questions. Also look for connections, thematically or otherwise, with the work you have in mind for them. They don’t have to be connected, but if they are, that can be a handy indicator that they can do the job you’re hiring for — because they’re already kinda doing it.\n\t\n* **What’s your favorite language? Why?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* You don’t necessarily need your programming language to be the favorite. Look more for the energy behind this question. They should be excited to talk about languages and should have enough knowledge of their favorite and others to give good reasons for liking it. The actual content of the answer doesn’t matter nearly as much as those factors: are they excited when they talk about languages, and do they seem somewhat familiar with more than one?\n\n* **Anything on the side?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* Ideally something. Side projects are another important indicator. The great developers are always exploring, fiddling and screwing around with experiments outside their day job. What that side project(s) consists of can also give you a glimpse at what they truly care about.\n\t\n* **Any experience with X?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* X in this case is some specific requirement or nice-to-have you have in mind. If they say no, be prepared to explain what it is you’re talking about to see if they at least get it conceptually. \n\n* **What do you do for fun?**\n\t*What you’re looking for:* This one can go two ways. If the answer is “more programming,\" that’s a good sign (see the Anything on the side question above). But it’s not a negative if that’s not the answer. After all, you want to hire interesting people who like to explore. You want to get a sense of that.

You want to hear how they thought through the problem and how it turned out.\n\t\nThe important thing to keep in mind with any of these is that they aren’t interview questions, and again, this isn’t an interview.

We can't outsource it for political reasons, so I suddenly find myself needing someone to handle this new project (and then stay on as our workload keeps increasing).\n\nOh, and I need the guy or gal to start as soon as humanly possible. Throw in a standard two-week notice and this backend resource is going to be coming into the project late and will have some catching up to do right away.\n\nIf you run into this sort of situation from a cold start - with no leads, no ideas, no possibilities - you're pretty screwed. Your only real options - before timelines start getting away from you - are either contract/freelance or call in the recruiters.\n\nAs soon as you get the go-ahead to hire, you should already be in a position where you can pick up the phone (so to speak) and call someone right away to set up an initial interview or contact.\n\nAnd the way you get there is to _always_ be in a hiring mode. This process never stops, because when it stops will be _the exact moment you need to hire someone_ (see: Murphy's Law).\n\nThe best time to get back into hiring mode if you've been out of it for a while is right after making a hire. There are always candidates you liked but weren't ready, or that you simply didn't get to connect with. Even better: often you'll find candidates that aren't a good fit for the position, but are perfect for another role on your team or in your company. \n\nMake a list of these folks and then follow them on Twitter, their blog, their GitHub, what have you. You want to keep an eye on them for a while - so you can confirm all those initial thoughts and be prepared for that hire-on-a-dime situation I mentioned earlier. Essentially, now's the time to do all the research you need so you can make a confident hire later.\n\nThe other trick to always being in a hiring mindset is that you have your eyes open enough to spot potential candidates when you're off-cycle. When you see a local developer building something interesting, make a note of it. When you see a developer complaining about their job, make a bigger note of it.\n\nSee, what you're trying to do is the greatly increase the surface area of your later search. Trying to tease out these kind of details in a two-week window when you're under the gun to make a hire is an exercise in futility. There's simply no time. But if you start that period already knowing that this guy feels underappreciated and knows exactly the programming language you need, you're already golden.\n\nYou can make your list something official-like - an Excel sheet, Google Doc or the like - if that's your style. Or you can just keep all this in your head. I typically do the latter, but to each their own.\n\nOne final note: One of the other advantages to [the Uninterview I talked about a while back](http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/book-preview-the-un-interview/), is that they're freeform enough that you can do them at almost any time. In other words: You can stockpile \"interviews\" well before you get an opportunity to hire.\n\n### What to watch for\n\nSo, as we're following all these developers long-term, there are certain behaviors/references you want to pay special attention to so you know a) which pressure points to use later, b) whether they would eventually be a good fit for your team, c) whether they can hack it.\n\n#### Displeasure with their current job\n\nPeople love to bitch about their job. It comes naturally and if you follow someone on Twitter or the like long enough, you'll start to notice patterns that can come in handy later.\n\nOne important note: Complaining about your job is not a character defect. Everybody does it, and your current employees - no matter how well you think you treat them - probably do it, too. No job is perfect … some are just more perfect than others.\n\nNow: If their entire social presence is complaining and whining, that's another story. But the occasional complaint is common, and useful when you get to later hiring stages.\n\nThe biggest ones to watch for are signs of boredom. As [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/) says, [\"bored people quit\"](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/). Someone who's bored at their current job is somebody who's ready to move - and is likely already starting to absent-mindedly surf job boards.\n\nThe other things to watch for are what particular pain points come up frequently, especially those that are direct opposition to how your own company operates:\n\n* **Bureaucracy:** Do they complain about things like vacation policies, timesheets, bad management, projects that get killed? \n* **Work-life balance:** Are they complaining about having to be at the office until late at night, or tweeting about work over the weekend? Most importantly: Is this a one-time thing? Or is it happening constantly?\n* **Feedback:** Do they complain about a lack of feedback on their job? \n\n#### Side projects\n\nOne of the other key things you want to look for is if they have development projects outside of their job. \n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nBecause, from my experience, you want to find inquisitive developers to hire. You want them to be willing to explore and learn. And side projects are one of the best possible indicators of that.\n\nMore than that, a developer with a side project likely has to be in a position where they need to think of the holistic product. They aren't in a position to just think about pure code, but they might also need to think about things like marketing, user experience and the like.\n\nAnd that's the type of developer you want to hire: Someone who can contribute more than code to your company. \n\nA developer that does more than right code can 10x their impact on your company right away. Adding a developer with this mindset into the creative process can reap dividends and any marketing experience points to new avenues to explore. \n\n#### References to multiple programming languages\n\nMuch like side projects, multiple languages suggests a preferred level of inquisitiveness.\n\nMore so, it can foretell a pragmatic, rather than dogmatic, approach to the work. \n\nIn business, dogma can be an absolute killer. Whether you're [lean](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), or some more traditional management philosophy, the last thing you want to do is waste cycles and time trying to fit square pegs in round holes. And when a developer has more tools in their toolbox, your chances of that happening become much less likely.\n\n**You want to hire flexible, pragmatic and curious developers that want to learn and grow with your company.**\n\nIt helps if you already see evidence of that.\n\nWhen you hire, you want to find a developer that knows (or can learn) your preferred language, but if they run across a problem that's better solved in some other language, you're going to be better off.\n\n#### Do they feel like a somebody you could hang out with?\n\nUltimately, who you hire will be someone you're going to end up spending a hell of a lot of time with - sometimes more than your immediate family.\n\nSo, it makes sense to make sure that the person you hire is somebody you can stand. \n\nHere it gets down to more abstract things:\n\n* **Similar interests:** In an ideal world, the folks you hire have a similar mindset to you. You don't want it to be exact, because then you get a boring staff that all think the same. However, you do want to find overlaps and common touch points. For instance, initial contact with one of our current employees was made after they made a reference to [\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas) It wasn't a big factor in the ultimate hire, but it was enough to pique my interest.\n* **General demeanor:** We touched on this in the earlier Displeasure with their current job section, but you can glean a lot about a candidate's personality from the social media footprint. Do they complain an inordinate amount? Are they friendly with lots of folks? Are they helpful?\n* **Likeability:** Check your favorites list. Do you see a single name popping up over and over? Make a note of it.","html":"<p>The key to a lot of the techniques I'm recommending you follow in hiring is to know the developer you're going to hire before you ever approach each other.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing ahead of time what drives your potential hire - negative and positive - and what their inherent skills are ahead of time eliminates a host of typical hiring bullshit.</p>\n\n<p>More than that, it gives you a leg up when it comes time to get them hired.</p>\n\n<p>There's few things more powerful to a typical human than feeling wanted, and saying to the candidate you like and want to hire, \"I've been following you for a while now, and I'm talking with you because I feel you would be a great fit at our company,\" does absolute wonders to get a initially hesitant candidate in the door.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's talk about how to do the research you need.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"followyourcandidatesevenwhenyoudonthaveanopening\">Follow your candidates, even when you don't have an opening</h3>\n\n<p>The thing with hiring is that it can happen at almost any time, and typically when you are least prepared.</p>\n\n<p>For instance: A new project landed on my department's desk this week, at a time when we have all backend resources tied up in other projects.

For instance, initial contact with one of our current employees was made after they made a reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas\">\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"</a> It wasn't a big factor in the ultimate hire, but it was enough to pique my interest.</li>\n<li><strong>General demeanor:</strong> We touched on this in the earlier Displeasure with their current job section, but you can glean a lot about a candidate's personality from the social media footprint. Do they complain an inordinate amount? Are they friendly with lots of folks? Are they helpful?</li>\n<li><strong>Likeability:</strong> Check your favorites list. Do you see a single name popping up over and over? Make a note of it.</li>\n</ul>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1409933874376,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1409933880090,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1409933880094,"published_by":1},{"id":87,"uuid":"488747af-a0ba-4c11-b202-77ee7bd794ef","title":"Broken pieces and the anti-vaxx movement","slug":"broken-pieces-and-the-anti-vaxx-movement","markdown":"<p style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%;\"><iframe width=\"512\" height=\"376\" src=\"http://video.pbs.org/viralplayer/2365322027\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless style=\"margin: 0px auto;\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, in advance of Nova&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/vaccines-calling-shots.html\">program on vaccines</a> (embedded above), I tweeted the following:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Vaccines do not cause Autism.

The\nconstant question we ask ourselves is: &#8220;Has somebody already done this\nfor us?&#8221;</p<>\n\n<p>How does this apply to you? You have to be <em>findable</em>. The best\ndevelopers are not likely going to search you out - you will either need\nto go to them or at least make sure that you can get your job or\npresence into the areas where they already are. That&#8217;s why posting a\njob ad in the <a href=\"http://rubyweekly.com/\">Ruby Weekly</a> can be so\neffective. They&#8217;re already there; they don&#8217;t have to go anywhere, and\nyour job notice is right in front of them.</p>\n\n<p>More than that, you want to remove any and all possible barriers for\napplication<a href=\"#fn:3\" id=\"fnref:3\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[3]</a>. The less work they need to do to let you know\nthey&#8217;re interested in an opening and the less research they need to do\nto find out if the job will work for them, the more effective you&#8217;re\ngoing to be.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p><strong>Impatience:</strong> Somewhat related to the above, you need to make it <em>as\n easy as possible</em> for the developer to know if the job is right for\nthem.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d let them know exactly how the company interested in\nhiring them operates, the space they&#8217;re in, and what their day-to-day\njob will look like. Think of it as being akin to staging a home. You\nwant them to be figuring out furniture placement by the time they&#8217;re\ndone reading the description.</p>\n\n<p>One other technique you could try if you're a technical recrutier: Offer to give them direct access to\nthe hiring manager to answer their questions, if said manager is up for it.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is about removing barriers. If a developer has to pop open\na fresh Google search to find what company you&#8217;re hiring for, you run\nthe very real risk that they won&#8217;t bother. </p>\n\n<p>After all, they&#8217;re lazy and impatient.</p>\n</li>\n\n<li><p><strong>Hubris:</strong> A common best-developer trait is that they think\n that\n they can accomplish almost anything<a href=\"#fn:4\" id=\"fnref:4\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[4]</a>. Each developer is a hammer, and\nthe world is full of nails.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you obviously don&#8217;t want to hire purely arrogant developers, but\ninside each developer you&#8217;ll ever hire, you&#8217;ll likely find a core of\nI-can-do-anything.</p>\n\n<p>And you can appeal to that sense, especially if the position you&#8217;re\nhiring for features a particularly difficult problem space or a\nparticularly interesting solution.</p>\n\n<p>The key takeaway for you: recruiting <em>is</em> sales and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Curtis sells and markets a product.

The less work they need to do to let you know  \nthey&#8217;re interested in an opening and the less research they need to do  \nto find out if the job will work for them, the more effective you&#8217;re  \ngoing to be.</p>  \n\n<p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p><strong>Impatience:</strong> Somewhat related to the above, you need to make it <em>as <br />\n easy as possible</em> for the developer to know if the job is right for\nthem.</p></p>\n\n<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d let them know exactly how the company interested in  \nhiring them operates, the space they&#8217;re in, and what their day-to-day  \njob will look like. Think of it as being akin to staging a home. You  \nwant them to be figuring out furniture placement by the time they&#8217;re  \ndone reading the description.</p>\n\n<p>One other technique you could try if you're a technical recrutier: Offer to give them direct access to  \nthe hiring manager to answer their questions, if said manager is up for it.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this is about removing barriers. If a developer has to pop open  \na fresh Google search to find what company you&#8217;re hiring for, you run  \nthe very real risk that they won&#8217;t bother. </p>\n\n<p>After all, they&#8217;re lazy and impatient.</p>  \n\n<p></li></p>\n\n<p><li><p><strong>Hubris:</strong> A common best-developer trait is that they think <br />\n that\n they can accomplish almost anything<a href=\"#fn:4\" id=\"fnref:4\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[4]</a>. Each developer is a hammer, and\nthe world is full of nails.</p></p>\n\n<p>Now, you obviously don&#8217;t want to hire purely arrogant developers, but  \ninside each developer you&#8217;ll ever hire, you&#8217;ll likely find a core of  \nI-can-do-anything.</p>\n\n<p>And you can appeal to that sense, especially if the position you&#8217;re  \nhiring for features a particularly difficult problem space or a  \nparticularly interesting solution.</p>\n\n<p>The key takeaway for you: recruiting <em>is</em> sales and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>Curtis sells and markets a product. You sell and market a <em>career</em>.</p>\n\n<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->  \n\n<p><link href=\"//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/slim-081711.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">  </p>\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">  \n    #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }\n    /* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.\n       We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */\n</style>  \n\n<div id=\"mc_embed_signup\">  \n<form action=\"//montabe.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=e0fec4ddb2e611b19c6fe7a40&amp;id=794b26f035\" method=\"post\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" target=\"_blank\" novalidate>  \n    <div id=\"mc_embed_signup_scroll\">\n    <label for=\"mce-EMAIL\">Want to learn more about DIY developer recruiting?
