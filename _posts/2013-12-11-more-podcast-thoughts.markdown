Since announcing the podcast idea [yesterday](http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/getting-back-into-the-podcast-game/), I've booked the first two guests.

My usual recording day will be Thursday evenings, but I intend to get a few in the can and launch it in early 2014 (which is closer than I remember it being).

I've also thought a lot more about it, including a probable name and what I really think are the intentions behind what I'm wanting to create.

At least at this early stage.

First off, for a name, I'm going with **"The Hallway"** for now. The reason for that (aside from being a nod to [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com)) is that I want it to be largely a series of informal chats about work and life as a developer and/or manager of developers these days.

The kind of conversation you have in office or conference hallways.

There are plenty of more-technical podcasts out there, and I don't really want to talk about libraries or text editors or anything related to the bits and bytes of being a developer.

I'm much more interested in the softer (so to speak) stuff. How'd you get to this point in your career? What's it like working remotely on a team of mostly on-site employees? What did you like most about the best job you ever had? If it's not your current job, what changed?

My own journey, career-wise, doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense (Sports Journalism to dev to management, back to dev, back to management), and I tend to find other people's stories along these lines fascinating.

But more than that, I'm less interested in what the work _is_ than how it happens.

Every project and, for the purposes of this podcast, every person involved has a story.

And those stories are what ultimately interests me.

A few other miscellany:

* I have no intention of ever doing sponsorships on this thing. I don't generally mind sponsorships on the podcasts I listen to, but I'm not doing this as a direct means of income. The primary reason is I just want to have these conversations and talk about these things; if it brings me (and my guests) a larger audience, so much the better, but it's not the primary goal.
* I largely want the guest list to not be the usual suspects. As I alluded to earlier, everybody has stories and insights, and I suspect we'll find out that those from a more unknown developer or manager will be just as fascinating (if not more so because the stories are new) as the names you know.
* For audio production purposes, I'm getting my new [Blue Yeti](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) mic delivered today. I'll largely be following [Jason Snell's advice](http://www.macworld.com/article/1162062/skype_garageband_podcast_tips.html), except using [Audio Hijack Pro](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/) instead of [Ecamm Call Recorder](http://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/), mostly because I have it already. Myself and my guest will each record our own end of the conversation and then I'll stitch it all back together before publishing.
* I'm still a bit undecided on hosting for the podcast. This blog is running off [Ghost](http://ghost.org), which doesn't exactly support that sort of thing. Most of my other sites are running off [Paperplane](http://paperplane.io) at this point, but I don't feel like finagling a static site generator to produce a podcast site and feed. I also have no intention of running Wordpress. In short: I'm exploring my options here and if you have suggestions, [let me know](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com).
* To start at least, I don't plan to have theme music or anything more than a [cold open](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open) and then maybe tacking a bit on at the end. We'll see how that goes.
* Every episode will have show notes, and hopefully fairly extensive ones.

Thank you all for following along. I'm still booking guests, so [drop me a line](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com) if the sort of conversation outlined above sounds like something you'd be interested in.
