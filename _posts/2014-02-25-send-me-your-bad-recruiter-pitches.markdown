title: Send me your bad recruiter pitches

<p>I&#8217;m conducting a bit of an experiment and I need your help.</p>

<p>Essentially, as I&#8217;ve been writing <a href="http://hiring.chrisvannoy.com">&#8220;The Hiring Handbook&#8221;</a>, I&#8217;ve been thinking more about the intended audience and am considering shifting gears a bit.</p>

<p>My original plan was to write it for hiring managers - folks like myself that are trying to recruit and hire developers without job ads, recruiters and the like.</p>

<p>But what I&#8217;ve realized is that those sorts of folks - again, like myself - really don&#8217;t hire all that often. There&#8217;s not an immediate monetary gain tied to hiring better.</p>

<p>Recruiters, on the other hand, have to recruit and hire <em>all the freaking time</em>, and I know from experience they could use a hand.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s where you come in: If you&#8217;re a developer these days, you get recruiter pitches on the regular. And I want them. I want to analyze them, maybe offer suggestions/improvements in posts here<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</p>

I want to make all our lives better by helping make _recruiters_ better.

<p>Take whatever recruiter pitches you have lying around, and forward them on to <a href="mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com">chris@chrisvannoy.com</a>.</p>

Or, if you'd rather, there's also a thread available on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7301113).

<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re a recruiter, feel free to send pitches by me first. I may eventually charge for this sort of service, but for now, I just need examples.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll redact all personal details, obviously - both your&#8217;s and the recruiter&#8217;s (unless I see a heaping pile of wrong coming through for one recruiting agency/person). <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
