title: Using Folding Text for book authoring

I've recently made a pretty significant change to my writing workflow when it comes to the book I'm writing and I'm really happy with it.

When I wrote ["The Outsourcing Playbook"][5613-001], I wrote it as a series of individual files in [Byword][5613-002], which made sense because it was originally intended to be more of an email course than ebook.

I still love Byword — in fact, I'm writing this blog post in it before pasting into [Ghost][5613-003] — but that style of writing, picking a chapter/topic and treating it as a standalone item, I found doesn't really scale all that well past the seven topics of that book.

I had started "The Hiring Handbook" in a similar fashion before realizing it just wasn't working. First off, I needed an outline rather than a random blob of topics I was storing in [Clear][5613-004] so I tried to organize things in some way and get a real sense of progress.

I'd had a copy of [Folding Text][5613-005] sitting on my laptop since it first launched, just looking for an opportunity to use it.

So, I started an outline for the book there.

Then I thought, what the hell, I'll add the stuff I've already written into the outline so I can see how much I have done and how much I have left.

And once I did that and started playing around with Folding Text, my entire writing workflow changed.

Thanks to FT's focus features, now I pick a section of the outline to write and <code>⌘]</code> a time or two to focus just on that section. I can then pop it fullscreen and write away.

Then when I save, it's all in one document and in the right place in said document.

It's a really fantastic writing environment — especially when what you're writing is long enough to require an outline.

And the best part of all (to me anyway) is that despite the <code>.ft</code> file extension, Folding Text documents are actually just plain text Markdown under the hood.

I can pop the file directly into [Marked][5613-006] to preview everything, or if I were planning to use automated PDF generation tools for the final output, I could flow it right into those.

If you haven't checked out Folding Text in the past, or, like me, have a copy sitting around looking for a use, I'd recommend giving it a throw for book authoring. It fits my needs to a tee.
