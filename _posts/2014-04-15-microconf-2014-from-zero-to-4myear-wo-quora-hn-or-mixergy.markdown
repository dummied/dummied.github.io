_NOTE: These recaps are a bit more for me than you. Iâ€™ll skip over stuff, include asides that are more personal notes to me, etc. Your mileage may vary. More detailed/sanctioned recaps will be available at http://microconfrecap.com at some point._

**Presenter:** [Jesse Mecham][2410-001]

* [YouNeedABudget.com](http://www.youneedabudget.com)
* Thought he'd be a public accountant. "That life is awful."
* Created a budget in Excel while in college.
* Kid on the way, decided to try to sell the spreadsheet.
* You don't need a vision. "I needed $350 a month" (for rent)
* "You can know nothing." Just started doing things as they came up.
* We can get caught up with trying to learn about our problem instead of concentrating on solving it.
* Be aware of how much you're consuming and how much you're creating
* Spreadsheet was "lowercase minimum valuable"
* "All these colors were available, so I used them."
* Now iterate. You're allowed to change your mind whenever you want
* Side note: Your price should be doubled. Until then, you might not sell anything.
* First version, $9.99 with a PayPal buy button.
* AdWords was so cheap (2004) that it brought in lots and lots of visitors, but first attempt was flyers at his apartment complex.
* "That was pretty exciting, but a total waste of time"
* Upped the price to $20, then first sale happened in a day.
* Go ahead and waste time. Wasted a lot of time learning. Less consuming, more doing.
* Make mistakes. You can't help it, because you don't know any better.
* This is like dieting, but for finances
* Find Your Message. You'll find it by writing sales copy for your product. Over and over again.
* Bubbles of solutions. Products cluster around similar problems. The way you compete is with a unique message.
* Settled on four rules for the system.
* Once settled on those rules, sales took off.
* $100 to anyone who can beat "Gain Total Control of Your Money" as a site headline.
* Lead with unique, that's why people give you money
* In his case, the budgeting method is the unique bit.
* Software is totally second-class in the message.
* "How are we different from Mint? Mint is like doing postmortem analysis."
* YNAB is like [precogs][2410-002]. There is no dead body.
* Keep iterating. Keep charging more.
* Auto-responders are still magical. 10-day "sales pitch" boosted revenues by ~200% overnight.
* "Why 10 days? Because that's how many I ended up with."
* There's no magic number or sequence. Just write it, get it set up and going.
* Anybody can copy our software, but that's not what sells.
* Don't be dumb like me, go full-time ASAP. Work: 80 hours per week for a $4,000/month salary. Sidegig(YNAB): One hour per week for $20,000/month in profits
* "I'm a recovering CPA."
* That was all in my safe gameplan. But do I want to be "that guy" in 20 years?
* You'll hit your stride. Gave a public launch date, off-shored development, raided personal funds, played golf to escape. Then hit stride.
* There's no value for you to promise something way off. You'll be wrong, it's stressful. Don't do public launch dates.
* Sell something soon. Write a crappy headline, put your "Buy Now" button below it. When somebody buys, tell them it'll be in their inbox in 48 hours. _I'm working on something like this right now, Ed._
* Bookkeeping: Do your books. It's tax day, that's why you do your books and that makes me sad. There's no value in complying with the tax code. <http://youneedabudget.com/business> teaches you how to use the same method for your business.

## Q&A

* [Steam][2410-003] users are crazy and hilarious to have in your web forums. We tried Steam like a year ago. Budgeting in a game. When they do flash sales (wouldn't normally do), they think it's a trial. Numbers are unbelievable. Was worried about support, but it was total impulse purchases so no increased load.
* "We recur with our major upgrades" Every 18 months to two years. The bad thing: you end up holding features for upgrades.
* Working on moving to a SaaS model.
* I spent $65k to build a version I could put on the Mac platform (in Java). It was a disaster. It was so bad, had to scrap it. Confidence in the message made it easier to move forward.
