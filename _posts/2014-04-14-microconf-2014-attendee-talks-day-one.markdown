_NOTE: These recaps are a bit more for me than you. Iâ€™ll skip over stuff, include asides that are more personal notes to me, etc. Your mileage may vary. More detailed/sanctioned recaps will be available at http://microconfrecap.com at some point._

## UX Basics that Convert Users into Customers

**Presenter:** [Samuel Hulick](https://www.twitter.com/SamuelHulick)

* Focus on the funnel itself.
* A lot jargon in UX
* Invest in your users' success
* How do you turn Mario into fireball Mario?
* The lifestyle difference is pretty profound there
* You're rewarded by turning people into awesomer people.
* Conversions are a byproduct of the value of the change you enable in customers and visitors
* Slight uptick in UX can have profound effect on entire funnel.
* Make money by making better people

## Building an Automated Content Marketing Machine

**Presenter:** [Brian Casel](https://www.twitter.com/CasJam)

* Case study of what's been happening with <http://restaurantengine.com>
* First year goals: Establish trust in an unknown industry; keep costs down; avoid becoming dependent on paid channels; establish a steady source of traffic/customers from organic/content channels; and systemize, automate, and outsource
* Last field on signup form, "How did you find out about us?" Vast majority is "Google"
* New blog post every Monday. Written by writing team. Some formatting guidelines. Sometimes review posts prior to publishing.
* Editorial calendar: Spreadsheet with topics sourced from industry forum "hot topics," popular posts on other industry blogs, look at data to see which topics resonate the most.
* Email list. Email opt-in on blog. Includes a free checklist on sign up (immediate value). Six-lesson email course autoresponder (value over time).
* Autoresponder increases email engagement, sets precedent that every email we send is worth reading.
* Newsletter goes out every Tuesday. Just announces the blog post.
* Guest blogging: target relevant industry blogs; build relationships with blog editors; writers produce the articles, he edits; CTA in author byline (CTA for newsletter); repeating monthly to-do.
* Improvements: targeted landing pages, multiple email courses on more focused topics, webinars, podcasts/re-purposing content.

## How to Buy Your Way to Fame and Fortune as a Bootstrapper

**Presenter:** [Dave Rodenbaugh](https://www.twitter.com/daverodenbaugh)

* Started as freelancer. Tired of trading hours for dollars.
* Build vs. Buy divide.
* Build you need to do everything from scratch. Buy, you can focus more on the promotion since you're buying a market and a product.
* Criteria for purchase price. Mostly looking for room to grow.
* [Flippa](http://flippa.com), eBay for websites.
* It's a large pile or garbage that requires diligence to actually find something
* Bought a few, turned out to be lousy business.
* Gave experience improving a website from scratch.
* [AWPCP][4578-001]: had some revenue, was ugly, too. On Flippa for 3.5k. Didn't sell. Contacted afterward, bought for 1k.
* The began the revamp
* Revenue increased, but discovered he added customer support to the workload.
* Had to outsource a developer
* Had a nonresponsive developer, hurt sales. Finally fired him.
* Another plugin ([Business Directory](http://businessdirectoryplugin.com)) from the same creator came across. Same problems he had to fix in AWPCP. Bought for 1.5k
* Revenue increased much more dramatically the second time.
* WP Plugins: Support is _everything_, raise your prices, customers love bundles, Wordpress.org is the Google equivalent, and follow the rules.
* About 65% of total revenue is in bundles.
* Can you do it? Yup. Find something that interests you on Flippa, buy something in your budget, improve the experience, get feedback
* There's inherent risk involved in this, hence the budget

## From Idea to $5000 a Month in 5 months

**Presenter:** [Josh Pigford](https://www.twitter.com/Shpigford)

* [baremetrics.io](http://baremetrics.io): SaaS metrics from [Stripe][4578-002]
* Felt like he was duct-taping stuff together  
* Idea on October 14, 2013. "Honey, I'm building a business tonight."
* Launched on November 14, 2013.
* Five takeways:
	* Build what you need, not what you _think_ others need. You have a problem. Chances are you're not a unicorn. May not be a viable business, but it's a start. Worst case, you've solved your own problem.
	* Charge from day one. Only one type of validation that matters: Money.
	* Stop trying to attain the perfect product. Buys time to learn the intricacies of the problem you're solving
	* Ship fast and ship frequently.
	* Price for the customer you want. $9 customer is an entirely different customer than $99.
