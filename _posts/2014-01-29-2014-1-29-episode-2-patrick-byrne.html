<p>Yes, we're starting with Episode Two. The reason? Episode One requires a bit more editing to make up for my own screwups and I wanted to get something out the door rather than waiting.</p>
<p>On to show notes.</p>
<p>Patrick Byrne and I talk about enterprise software, Dan Cederholm fanboyism, remote work, programming as writing, dopplegangers and goofballery.</p>
