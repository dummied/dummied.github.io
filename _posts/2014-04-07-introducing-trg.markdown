I just put the finishing touches on something I've been working on for a while (and am going to continue to work on for quite some time).

[TechRecruiterGuides.com](https://www.techrecruiterguides.com) is going to be a resource for helping technical recruiters become more effective at their jobs (while also not pissing off a slew of developers).

I talk more about this on [the about page](https://www.techrecruiterguides.com/about/) and the [introductory blog post](https://www.techrecruiterguides.com/blog/welcome-to-trg/) over there.

The first guide, ["The Technical Recruiter's Guide to Ruby"](https://www.techrecruiterguides.com/products/ruby/) is available to preorder now, or you can grab a sample chapter.

And for the devs out there: I you have something you think technical recruiters should know (about Ruby or anything else), [give me an earful](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com).

Bonus: I got this done in time for [MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com/).
