<p><em>Note: This post originally appeared on the blog of my since-shuttered analytics firm: Axiomatic. That said, if you need some analytics work, <a href="mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com">get in touch</a></em></p>
<p>You're busy, so we'll keep this brief. I have a New Year's Resolution to propose to you ...</p>
<p>I've talked to enough business owners at this point to recognize a disturbing trend - analytics going unglanced at for weeks or months at a time. On one such occasion, their entire funnel had stopped tracking six months earlier and no one had noticed ...</p>
<p>Because no one was looking.</p>
<p>In five minutes (or less), once a week, you can make sure your business and your website analytics are running smoothly.</p>
<p>And yes, I timed this.</p>
<h2>The Workflow</h2>
<p>On your dashboard, first expand the view out to the last six months.</p>
<p>Look at the sessions trendline. Everything look good and make sense?</p>
<p>Groovy.</p>
<p>Next up (with the time frame still extended), check on your goals or events if you have them set up.</p>
<p>Next: Acquisition > Channels > Organic Search.</p>
<p>Trend line look nice and stable or has a Google algorithm update screwed things up for you?</p>
<p>Now switch the time frame back to the last seven days and go back to Acquisition > All Referrals.</p>
<p>Look for sources you don't expect. Make a note or to-do to explore them later if that strikes your fancy. Keep in mind: there's been a large uptick in referral spam lately.</p>
<p>Run through any conversion goals you have against the list. Look for anomalies. Make a note or to-do.</p>
<p>Do the same for Acquisition > Campaigns.</p>
<p>That's it, you're done.</p>
<p>Do this once a week and rest easy that all's quiet on the Analytics front.</p>
