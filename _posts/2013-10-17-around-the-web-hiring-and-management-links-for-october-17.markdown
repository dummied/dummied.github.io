* **[Oracle and Compendium](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/compendium/index.html):** Another Indianapolis-based center of development talent gets acquired. Just run a find-and-replace on [this post of mine](http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/recruiting-from-instability/) from when Exact Target was acquired to see how you can turn that to your advantage as a hiring manager or recruiter.

* **[A Flexible Framework for Leveling Software Engineers](http://becomingmedium.com/blog/2013/09/24/career-levels/):** A nice breakdown of how to think about traditional hierarchical job titles/descriptions among engineers. The thought process also closely manages my current philosophy, though we have an extra level in there at the moment (Lead).

* **[The anatomy of the perfect technical interview from a former Amazon VP](http://firstround.com/article/The-anatomy-of-the-perfect-technical-interview-from-a-former-Amazon-VP):** You need to shift through some BS here and there, but this look at interviewing candidates has some good bits: "You want to hire people who are smart, that get stuff done and have the functional set of skills you need for the role," most notably. Admittedly, I don't do technical interviews anymore; entirely because I do my research ahead of time. Essentially, if you get to an interview, I already have a pretty good idea that you've passed that technical skill bar (which is also typically lower than you think).

* **[Using Trello to manage a large number of applicants](https://zapier.com/blog/resume-overload-how-dosomething-screens-job-applicants-finds-perfect-intern-stack-resumes/):** [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a nifty web app that makes it kind of a Swiss Army knife of tools. This example walks through using the app to keep track of a slew of applicants for a position.

* **[If Carpenters Were Hired Like Programmers](http://dawood.in/if-carpenters-were-hired-like-programmers/):** The other problem with most technical interviews. You want people who can learn and adapt, not someone who simply checks all your highly specific boxes.

* **[The Unexpectedly High Cost of a Bad Hire](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130716151946-2967511-the-high-costs-of-a-bad-hire-and-how-to-avoid-them):** The tips at the end are in a descending quality order: The first one's spot-on, the last one is bullshit.

* **[https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job_interview](https://github.com/ruby-jokes/job_interview):** If you do have to do a technical interview, consider this a nice little cheat sheet for you Ruby folks out there.
