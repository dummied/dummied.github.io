<p><a href="http://honeybadger.io">Honeybadger.io</a> cofounder <a href="http://www.bencurtis.com/">Benjamin
Curtis</a> gave a great talk (slides above) at <a href="http://microconf.com">MicroConf
2014</a><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> about how to sell products to
developers.</p>

<p>You can find my notes on the talk itself <a href="http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/microconf-2014-attendee-talks-day-two-phase-2/#sellingtodevelopersmissionimpossible">in the blog archives</a>.</p>

<p>The talk also provided a great window into how developers
think, especially when it comes to how they might think about any
job you&#8217;re offering them and how they approach both buying decisions and, roughly, career decisions.</p>

<p>In essence, Curtis talked about how developers are driven by
three things<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Laziness:</strong> From personal experience, one of the key driving forces for most developers can best be covered by simple laziness. The
constant question we ask ourselves is: &#8220;Has somebody already done this
for us?&#8221;</p<>

<p>How does this apply to you? You have to be <em>findable</em>. The best
developers are not likely going to search you out - you will either need
to go to them or at least make sure that you can get your job or
presence into the areas where they already are. That&#8217;s why posting a
job ad in the <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> can be so
effective. They&#8217;re already there; they don&#8217;t have to go anywhere, and
your job notice is right in front of them.</p>

<p>More than that, you want to remove any and all possible barriers for
application<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a>. The less work they need to do to let you know
they&#8217;re interested in an opening and the less research they need to do
to find out if the job will work for them, the more effective you&#8217;re
going to be.</p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Impatience:</strong> Somewhat related to the above, you need to make it <em>as
 easy as possible</em> for the developer to know if the job is right for
them.</p>

<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d let them know exactly how the company interested in
hiring them operates, the space they&#8217;re in, and what their day-to-day
job will look like. Think of it as being akin to staging a home. You
want them to be figuring out furniture placement by the time they&#8217;re
done reading the description.</p>

<p>One other technique you could try if you're a technical recrutier: Offer to give them direct access to
the hiring manager to answer their questions, if said manager is up for it.</p>

<p>Again, this is about removing barriers. If a developer has to pop open
a fresh Google search to find what company you&#8217;re hiring for, you run
the very real risk that they won&#8217;t bother. </p>

<p>After all, they&#8217;re lazy and impatient.</p>
</li>

<li><p><strong>Hubris:</strong> A common best-developer trait is that they think
 that
 they can accomplish almost anything<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>. Each developer is a hammer, and
the world is full of nails.</p>

<p>Now, you obviously don&#8217;t want to hire purely arrogant developers, but
inside each developer you&#8217;ll ever hire, you&#8217;ll likely find a core of
I-can-do-anything.</p>

<p>And you can appeal to that sense, especially if the position you&#8217;re
hiring for features a particularly difficult problem space or a
particularly interesting solution.</p>

<p>The key takeaway for you: recruiting <em>is</em> sales and marketing.</p>

<p>Curtis sells and markets a product. You sell and market a <em>career</em>.</p>
