title: Being a developer is not about how talented you are

<p>As I&#8217;ve been writing <a href="http://hiring.chrisvannoy.com">&#8220;The Hiring Handbook&#8221;</a>, I&#8217;ve also been reading a ton of blog posts and things about recruiting and hiring developers.</p>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224929">make me mad</a>,<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> some <a href="http://nickfranc.is/hiring-is-marketing">are good</a>, but all have helped me distill my thoughts on this to one simple core belief that everything I&#8217;m writing about centers around.</p>

<p>This belief is as follows:</p>

<p><strong><em>Being a developer is not about how talented you are. Development is not some born-with skill, but rather a set of skills acquired through practice.</em></strong></p>

<p>Like a tradesman - a plumber, carpenter, electrician or the like - the only way you learn to be or grow as a developer is through practice.</p>

<p>Code is craftsmanship and pragmatism. It&#8217;s about knowing when to say, &#8220;It ain&#8217;t a piano,&#8221;<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> and walking away or when to bang your head against the wall of a tough problem.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about knowing which questions to ask and where to find the answers.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the core of being a good developer. It&#8217;s not algorithms, or whiteboards, or CS degrees or anything else.</p>

<p>A developer is not a collection of talent, but rather a vessel of learning. A developer&#8217;s &#8220;talent&#8221; is the ability to see patterns in their work and to constantly improve that work.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not knowledge, because that will be gained along the way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s curiosity, a willingness to learn and work ethic.</p>

<p>And <em>that&#8217;s</em> what I hire for and the core of what I&#8217;m writing about.</p>

<p>Why that particular article made me mad is a post to come later. The short version: Everything before the last point is bullshit that shouldn&#8217;t be done &#8230; And that point is not good enough. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure where I picked up this idiom related to carpentry, but essentially, it&#8217;s about knowing which details to concentrate on and which to ignore. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
