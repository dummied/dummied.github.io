_NOTE: These recaps are a bit more for me than you. Iâ€™ll skip over stuff, include asides that are more personal notes to me, etc. Your mileage may vary. More detailed/sanctioned recaps will be available at http://microconfrecap.com at some point._

<p><strong>Teardowner:</strong> <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick McKenzie</a></p>

<h2><a href="http://hookfeed.com">HookFeed.com</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Explicitly mention money or revenue. Visceral reaction to those, people don&#8217;t make the leap on their own.</li>
<li>Maybe make the testimonial bigger and more prominent.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t love the positioning (&#8220;it&#8217;s time you knew what&#8217;s happening in your stripe account&#8221;). This is the batteries-not-included portion of Stripe, you could fix it, but we&#8217;ll do it for you instead.</li>
<li>Give names to pricing tiers. Make them customer segments - Solo, Small Business, Enterprise, for instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://sharpplm.com">SharpPLM</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Make it explicit who the intended customer is.</li>
<li>Testimonial is awesome, but edit quote so they understand it&#8217;s for manufacturers.</li>
<li>Mention who gave testimonial. This one, though, is made up.</li>
<li>Get testimonial: When customer happy, &#8220;would you say X, X, X?&#8221; If &#8220;yes&#8221; response, &#8220;Can I quote you on that?&#8221;</li>
<li>Drop testimonials where they tie into relevant part of buying process (ROI on buy page, for instance). Name value of testimonial = go home page. otherwise, get specific with placement.</li>
<li>Kinda long-form copy, but isn&#8217;t actually long form copy. Either go whole hog with it, or go with the standard SaaS thing. Mixing the two doesn&#8217;t always work well.</li>
<li>Pricing: Initial plan is per user than later&#8217;s aren&#8217;t. Make higher plan higher.</li>
<li>As expected from Patrick, &#8220;Charge more.&#8221;</li>
<li>CTA: &#8220;Get started now&#8221;, &#8220;Start winning more quotes now&#8221;</li>
<li>First time at your website, not convinced you&#8217;re trustworthy. Get email address instead of credit card on initial visit.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://backupoutlook.com">Backup Outlook</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Great SEO domain name</li>
<li>.org domain names = hidden secret of SEO domain names</li>
<li>Figure out a way to package product so you can segment and price differentiate</li>
<li>There are companies that will <em>require</em> a separate support contract<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>Think about adding an upper tier of cloud sync or backup.</li>
<li>People coming here after googling &#8220;backup outlook&#8221; are already sold on the idea.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="http://justaddcontent.com">Just Add Content</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Tagline: Doesn&#8217;t love it. There are lots of &#8220;website builder for businesses&#8221;. Assume the user knows this exists, figure out why they&#8217;re not using one already.</li>
<li>&#8220;Your website could look as professional as this one right now&#8221;</li>
<li>Selling to a non-technical audience: feel free to bash technology, and &#8220;we protect from that&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Technically true is the best kind of true.&#8221;</li>
<li>Marketing boss: If this is good enough for these guys, it must be good for me.</li>
<li>Underlying platform is Wordpress. So you can leverage the platform to build your business.</li>
<li>Feel free to ride on coattails.</li>
<li>Would be even better if &#8220;What you do&#8221; portion of the graph has <em>nothing</em> rather than &#8220;Add content.&#8221; Maybe a higher level of the plan where you provide the content or convert the content into the website. <em>This is brilliant, Ed.</em></li>
