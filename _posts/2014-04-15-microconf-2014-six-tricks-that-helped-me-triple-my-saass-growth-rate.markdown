_NOTE: These recaps are a bit more for me than you. Iâ€™ll skip over stuff, include asides that are more personal notes to me, etc. Your mileage may vary. More detailed/sanctioned recaps will be available at http://microconfrecap.com at some point. This one's a bit more slight because there's slides._

* I'm a hacker and I like growth
* I'm more of a marketer these days.
* Not using the "growth hacker" term, but might be talking about some things that are "gh-y"
* <http://planscope.io>, also two books, podcast, workshops
* I do this for family. Home office is the archenemies.
* Everything optimizes to less time in front of a computer.
* We're all here to grow
* [WoW][2089-001]: The idea is you want to level up. Just like business.
* We're all here to make more money.
* Planscope is 2-2.5 years old.
* "How big is your team?" .25 in a good week.

## The all important sales funnel

* Visitors > Trials > Activations > Paid
* Treat one, it affects all the others. Same with churn.
* Identify and tweak points of optimization.

1. Reacquire drive-bys. 
	* Retargeting (drive interested people back to you).
	* Information vs. product: Two paths, "Google, how do I raise my rates?" or "Google, I need project management software."
	* First group doesn't really know about Planscope. The second knows and needs the product.
	* One size fits all retargeting is a very bad idea.
	* First group: Facebook to email course. Second group, display network.
	* Retargeting is more than just converting visitors. Invite for 1-on-1 onboarding, rsvp for webinar, success stories or usage guides, product updates, reinforce lifecycle email communication
	* Retargeting as push RSS (retarget blog posts to paid customers)
2. Segmentation.
	* Goal: Make this a product-for-one
	* Are you a team or solo? Or you design or dev? How do you bill? Becomes choose-your-own-adventure onboarding. Devs get dev-based sample projects, for instance.
	* People think there are core difference that mean it won't serve their niche.
	* A perfectly placed "if" condition can go a long way toward improving conversions. Technically easy to do.
3. Trial scores
	* Lead scoring. Started scoring all new trials. So he can determine which trials to manual outreach.
	* Take a snapshot of db when a user buys. Find commonalities. If they do all the commonalities = 100% score.
	* Use to power different emails for good trial/bad trial sequences.
	* Then, what caused these scores to inform onboarding.
4. Educate everywhere
	* Your product is a very small part of customer's business.
	* Sends a manual email when a proposal closes. Responses become excellent testimonial fodder.
5. Do an exit interview
	* Funnel doesn't always give big picture
	* When you put credit card upfront, you require people to cancel, which means you can ask them why they're canceling.
	* This alone is one of the best features I've added to Planscope.
	* Look for trends, features that are missing, environmental factors. 
	* Why weren't you using? Find followup cancel opportunities.
	* Most emotional when they cancel, best time to gather feedback.
6. Increase LTV
	* Why don't you upgrade from trial now? I'll give you this book in exchange.
	* Figure out when accounts typically churn, email a few months before with a coupon discount for life. Make their account more valuable over time.

## Q&A

* No one's ever complained about privacy implications with sending email with first closed proposal.
* Constantly pausing autoresponders and send email out manual instead.
* Customer happiness scores, weighted by probability of converting? 100 score is typical conversion. Not scientific.
* How do you maintain the state of mind when working on the product so little at times? Early mornings. Have a lot of other stuff going on. No multitasking. Support is more intermittent.
* Biggest competition is Excel and email. Newsletters/ebooks make more sense to educate on the existence of a problem. Less friction than signing up for an account.
