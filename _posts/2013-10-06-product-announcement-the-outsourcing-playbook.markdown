<p>While I'm still working on the larger book about hiring in-house developers, I took a brief tangent and wrote a short ebook on the other side of the coin - finding, hiring and managing outside developers.</p>

<p>I wrote it mostly because I've learned a lot of fairly painful lessons along the way when it comes to this topic … And it's one I've never seen a lot of advice on.</p>

<p>The package walks through finding development partners, setting the proper expectations and doing everything you can to ensure you can get as accurate a bid as possible.</p>

<p>I had to learn all this on my own, and I figure you shouldn't have to.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/DJBa">buy the book on Gumroad</a>, or sign up for the later book on hiring in-house developers below.</p>

<p>In the meantime, what you'll find in the rest of this post is a sample section of the book. Enjoy, and let me know if you have any thoughts or questions.</p>

<p>As part of my day job, I have to hire a lot of outside developers and development firms for projects. I’ve made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I’m going to tell you how to avoid them and find the best possible person or firm to tackle your project.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, let’s talk about why this process is fraught with peril.</p>

<p>You probably have a picture in your head that hiring outside developers and managing them will be easier than doing a project in-house. You wrap up the project details, fire it off and forget about it until it gets done.</p>

<p>Easy-peasy, right?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Let’s break down the differences between in-house and outside developers.</p>

<p>When a project is done by an in-house staff, you get a slew of advantages. You can push scope if need be to keep a client happy. You can adjust the workload in other places to throw more people at a project in trouble. The communication is easy — after all, they’re in the same room or building or chat room as you. Status updates are easy; adjustments are easy; compared with outside developers, everything’s easy.</p>

<p>Your scope can be kind of loose because your in-house developers have the authority to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>Most importantly, your in-house development team has a direct stake in the outcome. It’s your company’s name on the work, and, therefore, the team’s reputation. Caring makes a whole lot of things easy from a management perspective.</p>

<p>Almost everything about working with an outside development firm, on the other hand, is <em>hard</em>.</p>
