_NOTE: These recaps are a bit more for me than you. Iâ€™ll skip over stuff, include asides that are more personal notes to me, etc. Your mileage may vary. More detailed/sanctioned recaps will be available at http://microconfrecap.com at some point._

## How to scratch your own itch (and not)

* Start with problems
* "Scratch your own itch fallacy": We've all been scratching our itches. There are less itchy things.
* Validate the market
* Don't start writing code right away
* Start market-first.
* Find 10 people willing to pay $X. Emailed 17 people, got 11 commitments.
* All conversions where software. No's were infoproduct/bloggers.
* Lessons: start with problems, niche down, describe the value you provide (not specifics), name a price, hold your idea loosely

## Building the list

* First circle is your audience. Not try to sell, but gauge interest.
* Second circle: friends and colleagues' networks. 
* Third circle: Press.
* Fourth: Facebook ads
* Fifth: Powered by link in bottom of Drip widget.

## The Slow Launch (Part 1)

* Pick the right early customers
* Become a developer for hire. You become an unpaid consultant.
* Rush, but take your time
* Spent a month onboarding the first customer:
	* Embeddable widget
	* Broadcasting bits in addition to autoresponder campaigns
	* Kinda need to pause or delete things
	* Mailchimp integration
* After a month, hit a roadblock: You should not build this feature. It's too complicated. "It's not you, it's me"
* Both of next two customers needed the same features they built for potential Customer 1.
* Long-ass list of features that needed added before adding more.
* Wrong turn: Let a blogger into early access. Not his audience. Wanted deep WP integration, Android, visual editors. Wanted him to build Mailchimp. 
* Had a literal FAQ. Got the same questions over and over again.
* Lessons: pick the right early customers, pick early customers with similar needs, go high-touch, name your price upfront (but don't charge until customer receives ample value), save correspondence to build FAQ, trial emails, etc.

## Onboarding

* MPA: Minimum Path to Awesome.
* Two Step MPA: install the javascript snippet, set up an email course
* They'll create the course for you from blog posts or similar, or give you templates to edit, or write the stuff for you (for a fee).
* If you're doing a javascript snippet, integrate with [segment.io][6841-001].
* Trial emails: Say the same things you say in the app in the emails. Lead with value.
* Lessons: determine your app's MPA, guide new users through it, do it again via email, offer to do it for them (concierge)

## The Slow Launch (Part 2)

* The hard work was already done before emailing the entire list
* Wait until onboarding is working
* Divide your list into cohorts
* Launch emails sequence with a time-limited discount
* Wait length of trial
* Repeat it for the next list segment
* $7k/month in first month

## Q&A

* How to pay folks during a slow launch. Other projects pay for development of the next one.
* Iterate between cohorts of large list? Made some changes, but nothing so big that it felt like it made a difference. Did update the onboarding, but more user feedback type of stuff.
