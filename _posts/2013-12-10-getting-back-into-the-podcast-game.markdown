A good while back, I did a daily(!) podcast of Indianapolis news topics tied to my [FollowIndy](http://followindy.com) project.

They were five-minute episodes and were just me and a headset mic.

It was surprisingly hard work, not so much in the editing or the topic selection, but more in the lonliness of it. It was just talking to myself and I spent hours writing scripts and such.

About that time, I was also a guest on a since-defunct Indy-area podcast (that's me in [episode #27 there](http://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail?pid=97728)). That, where I could bounce off someone else, I found much more fun.

It was much less work because I didn't really have to write a script or even come up with many topics. It was closer to having a conversation that happened to be recorded.

In the years since, I've listened to a heck of a lot of podcasts. I've also been thinking/writing a lot more about things that I don't really get to talk to many people about (things like [hiring](http://hiring.chrisvannoy.com) and managing developers, obviously).

So, I figure I can kill two birds with one stone.

I'm still working on a name, URL and all the rest of it, but I'm going to be starting a podcast soon on those sorts of topics. 

If you have thoughts or a story to tell along the following lines (or something else I might find interesting), [get in touch](mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com) and we'll chat.

* The worst (tech) job interview you ever had.
* Conversely, the best.
* Working with remote employees.
* Working _as_ a remote employee.
* Moving from development to management.
* Project management.
* The developer mindset (aka. The zone and why it's so important).

As I haven't done the podcast hosting thing before, I might be reaching out to a specific person or two for this first one so I can have all my ducks in a row for later.

As a final note, I might be a guest in the coming months on one of my favorite [5by5](http://www.5by5.tv) podcasts. I'll let you know when/if that actually pans out.
