I've had my short ebook, ["The Outsourcing Playbook"](https://gumroad.com/l/DJBa), in the wild for a while now and I have made a few adjustments.

First off, I adjusted the pricing on Gumroad to be pay-what-you-want on the pdf version (including free).

So, [go get that now](https://gumroad.com/l/DJBa).

Additionally, because I wanted to get this out to as many people as possible, I whipped up a quick and dirty HTML version of the book.
