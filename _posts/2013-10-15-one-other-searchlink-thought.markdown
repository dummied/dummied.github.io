One other quick thought on my experimenting with [SearchLink][2181-001]:

I've followed [Brett Terpstra][2181-002] for quite some time now and have always been a little amazed by [the services](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/) he's been able to crank out. But before today, I'd never popped the hood open on one.

[What I found inside](http://blog.chrisvannoy.com/rvm-and-searchlink-cant-we-all-just-get-along/) surprised and excited me. In essence, it's a very small [Automator][2181-003] workflow that ties together with a relatively small Ruby script.

That's it.

I _know_ Ruby. I _love_ Ruby. And suddenly realizing that the sort of work Brett cranks out is _totally_ within my own reach means I'm finding myself looking at my day-to-day and wondering what I could enhance or optimize through something similar.

It's as if a whole world of possibilities suddenly opened up to me.

So, thanks Brett - both for the awesome work you do and for unlocking a whole new way of looking at the world for me.
