<p><em>Note: This post originally appeared on the blog of my since-shuttered analytics firm: Axiomatic. That said, if you need some analytics work, <a href="mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com">get in touch</a></em></p>
<p>A long time ago, I had published advice for event organizers to save a few characters and leave off a year reference when picking a Twitter hashtag for their event.</p>
<p>So, rather than <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23rubyconf14&amp;src=typd">#rubyconf14</a>, you could safely shave off two characters and go with simply <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23rubyconf&amp;src=typd">#rubyconf</a> instead.</p>
<p>The thought process at the time was that you could only search seven days worth of tweets and the year addendum was kind of worthless in that environment.</p>
<p>Now that Twitter is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-complete-tweet-index">indexing and making searchable</a> their entire corpus of tweets, that recommendation needs a change.</p>
<p>If you are in charge of picking the hashtag for an event or some other time-based thing, you should probably strongly consider adding a year or date indicator to the end to make later searches a bit easier.</p>
<p>It would appear you can <a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced">time-limit searches</a>, but that sort of advanced maneuver isn't something you can expect all users (or all embedding platforms) to grok.</p>
<p>So, the new recommendation:</p>
<p>When in doubt, include the year. It'll make your event tweets easier to find later.</p>
<p>Oh, and as always, make sure you let participants know what the official hashtag is so you don't end up with multiple streams like the #rubyconf examples above.</p>
