<p><em>Note: This post originally appeared on the blog of my since-shuttered analytics firm: Axiomatic. That said, if you need some analytics work, <a href="mailto:chris@chrisvannoy.com">get in touch</a></em></p>
<p>I just pushed live <a href="http://qstoa.axiomaticllc.com?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=crosslink">Questions to Answer</a>, a free tool to find out what questions people might be asking about your topic of choice.</p>
<p>It's an idea I've been noodling on for quite some time, but really came together in the last 24 hours or so.</p>
<p>Qstoa uses a technique I've used for clients in the past who wanted to know what content they should write or what products they should build.</p>
<p>Essentially, it takes your topic of choice, adds the essential who, what, why, where and how questions to the end (and a few extra goodies), runs them through Google's search keyword suggestion endpoint to get what are - theoretically - the most popular related searches.</p>
<p>Do head over and <a href="http://qstoa.axiomaticllc.com?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=crosslink">give it a whirl</a> to get a better idea.</p>
<p>As a final note: It also gives you the option of downloading the terms as a handy-dandy <code>csv</code> file that can then be easily imported into the Google Keyword Planner to figure out just how much traffic goes to each.</p>
