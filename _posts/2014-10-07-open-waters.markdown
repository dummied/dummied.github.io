<p>I lost my job yesterday. </p>

<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t &#8220;lose&#8221; it. It was taken away from me. </p>

<p>Due to a number of factors<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>, I lost focus while doing a high-profile bit of work for a client - said work wasn&#8217;t originally part of the job description. I wasn&#8217;t delivering what our client wanted. </p>

<p>But more than that, I had lost focus. But, then, the level of focus they wanted is something I could never really deliver.</p>

<p>While on the job (and when necessary outside of it), I was committed 100%. When I wasn&#8217;t at work? That was my time, and I had things I wanted to do.</p>

<p>The thing is, for long before this job - heck, four jobs ago - I&#8217;ve wanted something of my own. </p>

<p>Something that belonged to me. </p>

<p>I originally took this job - despite some misgivings - because I felt it gave me the best chance to get closer to that. </p>

<p>And ultimately, that same reason for taking the job at least partially cost me the job. </p>

<p>So, for the first time in my professional life I am adrift. I have no job lined up - a few applications out and interviews already set up - but nothing set in stone. </p>

<p>And at the same time, I&#8217;m making a concerted sprint to see if i can make a go at it solo. </p>

<p>To have something I own - if only my name and work. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting off with four areas of focus:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://brasstacks.chrisvannoy.com">Brass Tacks</a>:</strong> A service so good, I partially lost my job because of it, Brass Tacks is the aspirin for when your analytics give you a headache. I hear so many entrepreneurs and others lament getting anything useful out of <a href="http://google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> and I&#8217;ve spoken to (and done work for) so many clients that I want to help. I know these analytics platforms - GA, Omniture, WebTrends, you name it - backways and frontways.</p>

<p>And more importantly, I know how to make those platforms give you the answers and data you need to make <em>actionable</em> business decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://transmogrify.chrisvannoy.com/">Transmogrify</a>:</strong> This is the next step after Brass Tacks. Once you know your numbers, how do you make them <em>better</em>?</p>

<p>Through AB and multivariate testing, Transmogrify systematically drives those numbers upward - creating more revenue, more contacts and making your website as efficient as it can possibly be.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recruiting:</strong> I&#8217;m not a recruiter, but I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.techrecruiterguides.com">written</a> and thought so much about recruiting developers that I&#8217;d love to help out there as well.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned above, I&#8217;m not going to directly recruit developers for you, but what I can do (for a reasonable fee, considerably less than a recruiter) is consult with you about how you approach developer hiring - what you need to look for, where you need to look and how you should pitch your opening and ultimately close the deal.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a <em>highly effective</em> developer recruiter as a manager. And I want to help you become the same.</p>

<p>And, if you&#8217;re a technical recruiter yourself, I want to make you better at your job so you can close more hires - now and into the future - by knowing how developers think and how to push the right buttons to get them onboard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll have a landing page with more details about this up in the next day or so. Follow me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chris_vannoy">on twitter</a> if you&#8217;re interested. I&#8217;ll announce it there first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developer Management Coaching:</strong> When I first transitioned from developer to manager of developers, it was <em>rough</em>. I was trying to do both things at once and I was still in developer mode most of the time.</p>

<p>And that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>More than anything, I wanted somebody I could talk to about managing a development team.</p>

<p>This last go-around was very successful as a development manager - I&#8217;ve learned a lot and grew by leaps and bounds. And I want to help others - both those new to managing developers and old hands - get better at it.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re struggling as a manager - or if you just promoted somebody new to management - I&#8217;m available to provide coaching.</p>

<p>More details about that service will be up in the next day or two.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On top of all those<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>, I&#8217;m also going to keep building <a href="http://beta.whatthedeploy.com">WhatTheDeploy</a>. The issue there is that I don&#8217;t know that I can get it ramped up into full-time income as quickly as I need it to.</p>

<p>I have - at most - six weeks of hustle to see if I can make any of those work. And if the right job comes through, I&#8217;ll jump at that instead.</p>

<p>Because, after all, I have a family to support.</p>

<p>And that matters far more than my needing to feel like I have something I own.</p>

<p>At least for right now.</p>

<p>Yes, it seems like a lot. But they&#8217;re all fields I&#8217;ve dabbled with in the recent past - either on the job or on the side. And now, rather than just having nights and weekends available, I have entire days available to work on them. If one area accelerates more quickly than the others, I&#8217;ll &#8220;pivot.&#8221; <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
