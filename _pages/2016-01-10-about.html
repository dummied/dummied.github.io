<h2 class="text-align-center"><span style="font-size:14px; font-weight:normal; line-height:1.68em">"The Hallway" is largely a series of informal chats about work and life as a developer and/or manager of developers these days.</span></h2>
<p>The kind of conversation you have in office or conference hallways.</p>
<p>There are plenty of more-technical podcasts out there, and I don't really want to talk about libraries or text editors or anything related to the bits and bytes of being a developer.</p>
<p>I'm much more interested in the softer (so to speak) stuff. How'd you get to this point in your career? What's it like working remotely on a team of mostly on-site employees? What did you like most about the best job you ever had? If it's not your current job, what changed?</p>
<p>My own journey, career-wise, doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense (Sports Journalism to dev to management, back to dev, back to management), and I tend to find other people's stories along these lines fascinating.</p>
<p>But more than that, I'm less interested in what the work <em>is</em> than how it happens.</p>
<p>Every project and, for the purposes of this podcast, every person involved has a story.</p>
<p>And those stories are what ultimately interests me.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it interests you, too.</p>
